Federal	Court	in	Florida	Enters	Order	Freezing	Assets	in	CFTC	Foreign	Currency	Anti-
Fraud	Action	against	Allied	Markets	LLC	and	its	Principals	Joshua	Gilliland	and	Chawalit
Wongkhiao

CFTC	Charges	Jacksonville,	Florida,	Defendants	with	Operating	a
Fraudulent	Forex	Pool	and	Misappropriating	Customer	Funds	to	Pay
Personal	Expenses

Washington,	DC	—	The	U.S.	Commodity	Futures	Trading	Commission	(CFTC)	today	announced	that	it	filed	a	civil
enforcement	Complaint	in	the	U.S.	District	Court	for	the	Middle	District	of	Florida,	charging	Defendants	Allied	Markets
LLC,	and	its	principals	Joshua	Gilliland	and	Chawalit	Wongkhiao,	all	of	Jacksonville,	Florida,	with	operating	a
fraudulent	foreign	currency	(forex)	commodity	pool	in	violation	of	the	Commodity	Exchange	Act	(CEA)	and	CFTC
Regulations.	In	addition,	none	of	the	Defendants	has	ever	been	registered	with	the	CFTC,	as	required.

On	January	7,	2015,	the	day	after	the	CFTC	Complaint	was	filed	under	seal,	U.S.	District	Judge	Marcia	Morales	Howard
issued	an	emergency	Order	freezing	and	preserving	assets	under	the	Defendants’	control	and	prohibiting	them	from
destroying	documents	or	denying	CFTC	staff	access	to	their	books	and	records.	The	Court	has	scheduled	a	hearing	for
January	21,	2015,	on	the	CFTC’s	motion	for	a	preliminary	injunction.

The	CFTC	Complaint	charges	that,	as	early	as	January	2012,	the	Defendants	fraudulently	solicited	more	than	$1	million
from	members	of	the	public	to	trade	forex	in	a	commodity	pool.	As	alleged,	Defendants	Gilliland	and	Wongkhiao
misappropriated	funds	to	pay	their	personal	expenses.	For	example,	instead	of	trading	forex	as	promised,	they	allegedly
withdrew	approximately	$850,000	in	pool	participant	funds	from	the	Allied	Markets	forex	account,	spending	more	than
$64,000	of	the	stolen	funds	on	restaurants	and	entertainment;	approximately	$33,000	on	travel,	hotels	and	rental	cars;
and	approximately	$66,000	on	rent	for	their	residence	in	Jacksonville	Beach,	Florida.	They	also	transferred	at	least
$83,200	to	their	personal	bank	accounts	and	withdrew	approximately	$139,000	in	cash	from	automated	teller	machines
and	at	bank	branches,	the	Complaint	charges.

Defendants	also	used	pool	participant	funds	to	pay	purported	trading	profits	and	supposedly	returned	pool	participants’
principal	in	the	manner	of	a	Ponzi	scheme,	according	to	the	Complaint.

Specifically,	according	to	the	Complaint,	the	Defendants	solicited	members	of	the	public	to	send	them	money	for	forex
trading	by	fraudulently	guaranteeing	specific	trading	returns	and	by	making	material	misrepresentations	regarding	their
trading	expertise	and	results,	including	that	Defendants’	forex	trading	was	generating	large	profits.

In	its	continuing	litigation,	the	CFTC	seeks	full	restitution	to	defrauded	pool	participants,	disgorgement	of	any	ill-gotten
gains,	a	civil	monetary	penalty,	permanent	registration	and	trading	bans,	and	a	permanent	injunction	against	future
violations	of	the	CEA	and	CFTC	Regulations,	as	charged.

The	CFTC	appreciates	the	assistance	of	the	Jacksonville	Beach	Police	Department,	the	Jacksonville	Sheriff’s	Office,	the
Florida	Office	of	Financial	Regulation,	the	United	States	Marshals	Service,	and	the	National	Futures	Association.

CFTC	Division	of	Enforcement	staff	members	responsible	for	this	action	are	Jonah	McCarthy,	Patricia	Gomersall,	Dmitriy
Vilenskiy,	Jonathan	Robell,	John	Einstman,	and	Paul	Hayeck.
