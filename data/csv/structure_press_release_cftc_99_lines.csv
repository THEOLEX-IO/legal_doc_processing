CFTC Charges California Resident Jason B. Scharf, His Worldwide Web of Companies, and
Florida-Based Affiliate Marketers Michael Shah and Zilmil, Inc. with $16 Million Binary
Options Fraud Scheme

CFTC Complaint Charges Numerous Companies, Including CIT Investments LLC, Brevspand EOOD, CIT
Investments Ltd., CIT Investments Ltd., and A & J Media Partners, Inc., with Participating in Massive Fraud

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Assets of Scharf, Shah & Zilmil; Order Grants the CFTC
Immediate Access to Their Books and Records

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that a federal district court
has unsealed a civil CFTC Complaint with the Middle District of Florida on July 10, 2017, charging Jason B. Scharf of
Valley Village, California, a worldwide web of companies he controlled, including CIT Investments LLC, a Nevada limited
liability corporation; Brevspand EOOD, a Bulgarian business entity; CIT Investments Ltd., a Marshall Islands business
entity; CIT Investments Ltd., an Anguillan business entity; and A & J Media Partners, Inc., a California corporation,
together with affiliate marketers Michael Shah and his company Zilmil, Inc., both of Jacksonville, Florida, with
unlawfully soliciting and accepting more than $16 million in connection with illegal binary options contracts. Scharf also
does business as Citrades.com and AutoTrading Binary.com, according to the Complaint.

In addition, the Complaint charges Scharf, Shah, and Zilmil with acting as Futures Commission Merchants (FCM) and
Commodity Trading Advisors (CTA) without being registered with the CFTC, as required.

On July 12, 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Brian J. Davis entered a Statutory Restraining Order freezing the assets of
Scharf, Shah, and Zilmil, prohibiting them from destroying their books and records, and granting the CFTC immediate
access to those records. The Court has scheduled a hearing for July 26, 2017 to determine whether to enter an order for
preliminary injunction against the Defendants and also to determine, among other things, whether the court should
continue the freeze on Defendantsâ assets.

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, stated:

The CFTC continues to be committed to rooting out and prosecuting binary options fraud in our markets. As alleged,
the fraudulent scheme here involved false claims of outsized profits, fake testimonials, and âguaranteed returns.â
And the scheme, as alleged, was massive, resulting in the misappropriation of over $16 million from more than
8,000 customers. This action should send a message to would-be fraudsters that the sort of conduct alleged here
will not be tolerated. We thank our international law enforcement partners for their assistance in this case.

Scharfâs Website Citrades.com Claims: âThe Most Profitable Click You Will Ever Make.â

Binary options are transactions that allow customers to make predictive trades as to whether the price of a certain
commodity will rise or fall by a certain date and time. As alleged in the CFTCâs Complaint, binary options must be traded
on a registered board of trade in order to be lawfully offered in the United States. The Complaint alleges that neither
Scharf, Shah, nor Zilmil executes transactions on a registered board of trade and none has ever been registered with the
CFTC in any capacity.

The Complaint alleges that since at least January 2014 and continuing to the present, Shah and Zilmil have attracted
potential customers through fraudulent ad campaigns to purchase binary options trading systems, and steer interested
customers to binary options websites like those operated by Scharf. According to the Complaint, Scharf and his
companies then fraudulently solicit customers to open binary options accounts with false claims of outsized profits and
âguaranteed returnsâ trading binary options, bolstered by fake testimonials of purportedly successful customers. The
Complaint further alleges that once customers fund binary options accounts, they do not get their money back. Instead,
the Complaint alleges that the funds are routed through numerous foreign corporations and overseas accounts before
being spent on business and personal expenses, and compensating Shah and Zilmil.

Misappropriation of Customer Funds

According to the Complaint, the Defendantsâ binary options scam has been extremely lucrative. As alleged, Scharf and
his companies have misappropriated more than $16 million from at least 8,000 victims, most of them located in the
United States.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customer, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil
monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and permanent injunctions from future violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC cautions that Orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Anguilla Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervision
Commission of the Republic of Bulgaria.
The CFTC also thanks the IRS - Criminal Investigation, Cincinnati Field Office, and the FBI Cleveland Division, as well as
the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office for their substantial assistance on this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Ashley Burden, Heather Dasso, Melissa Cavers,
Eric Schleef, Joseph Konizeski, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Charges California Resident Hannes Tulving, Jr., through his company, The Tulving
Company, Inc., with Misappropriation and Fraudulent Solicitation in a $17.8 Million
Precious Metals Scheme

At Least 381 Customers Nationwide Allegedly Defrauded in the Scheme

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil Complaint against
Defendants Hannes Tulving, Jr. of Newport Beach, California, and his company, The Tulving Company, Inc., charging
them with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation in connection with the precious metals markets. Neither
Defendant has ever been registered with the CFTC.

In its enforcement action, the CFTC alleges that the Defendants fraudulently offered contracts of sale of commodities in
interstate commerce, namely, contracts for the sale of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium bullion and coin (precious
metals). In offering these contracts, the Defendants obtained and misappropriated at least $17.8 million from at least
381 customers located throughout the United States for the purchase and sale of precious metals, according to the
Complaint.

In their solicitations, the Defendants allegedly made false and fraudulent representations, including that The Tulving
Company was a highly reputable, stable, and established precious metals firm that delivered precious metals to
customers; that it bought and sold in excess of $2.1 billion in precious metals from 1999 through March 2013; and that
precious metals were shipped quickly to customers after placement of orders and receipt of customer funds. These
representations were false, according to the Complaint.

The Defendants allegedly purchased and sold little or no precious metals with the funds they collected from customers.
Instead, according to the Complaint, the Defendants defrauded customers by lying to them and misappropriating their
funds for improper and unauthorized uses, including for the Defendantsâ own financial benefit.

To conceal their fraud, according to the Complaint, the Defendants made false and/or deceptive statements, including
falsely representing that (1) customers owned specific amounts of precious metals when, in fact, they did not, (2)
customers holdings in precious metals had significant value when, in fact, the non-existent holdings had no value
whatsoever, and (3) customers were realizing profits from their investments when, in fact, no profit whatsoever had been
realized.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil
monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of
federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Orders Florida Company to Pay $75,000 for Registration Violations

July 20, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling an
enforcement action against Southwest Group, LLC of Fort Myers, Florida for acting as an unregistered retail foreign
exchange dealer. The order requires Southwest Group to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, as charged, and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $75,000.

The order finds that from April 2018 through September 2018, Southwest Group, through its website, offered transactions
in off-exchange foreign currency (forex) on a financed basis to retail customers located throughout the United States who
were ineligible contract participants. These retail forex transactions involved Vietnamese Dong or Iraqi Dinar.

According to the order, Southwest Group offered customers forex transactions by utilizing a âPremium + Layaway
Programâ financing option. This âprogramâ was financed by Southwest Group while acting as the counterparty to these
retail forex transactions. Instead of retail customers receiving their forex within two days of the transactions, it took 30 or
45 days.

The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a companyâs registration with the CFTC before committing funds. If
unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that company. A companyâs registration status can be
found using NFA BASIC.

Federal Court Orders Florida Attorney Jay Bruce Grossman to Pay a Civil Penalty and
Restitution Totaling $883,000

Grossman Agrees Not to Appear or Practice as an Attorney before the
CFTC

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Beth Bloom of
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a Consent Order against Defendant Jay Bruce
Grossman, who practices law in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The Consent Order requires Grossman to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and restitution of $733,000 in
connection with Grossmanâs aiding and abetting multiple clients in their operation of illegal and fraudulent precious
metals schemes in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) The Order also permanently enjoins Grossman from
committing further violations of the CEA, as charged, and requires Grossman not to appear or practice as an attorney
before the CFTC until such time as he has been reinstated by Order of the CFTC.

The Order arises out of the CFTC Complaint filed on September 9, 2014 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 6990-14).
According to the CFTC Complaint, Grossman, in his capacity as an attorney, aided and abetted multiple clients in their
operation of unlawful precious metals schemes by crafting the illusion that their schemes were legitimate and complied
with the law, when in fact they were neither.

The CFTC previously obtained the following judgments against Grossmanâs clients:

* On May 16, 2014, a federal court in Florida found that Grossman client Hunter Wise and its owners committed
ârepeated, callous, and blatantâ fraud in their operation of a precious metals scheme and ordered Hunter Wise and
its owners to pay $52.6 million in restitution to defrauded customers and a $55.4 million civil monetary penalty in
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC, Case No. 9:12-cv-81311-DMM (S.D.
Fla.) (see CFTC Press Release 6935-14, May 22, 2014).

Â¢ On July 24, 2014, a federal court in Florida ordered Grossman client AmeriFirst Management and its owners to
pay $25 million in restitution and a $10 million civil monetary penalty for their operation of a fraudulent precious
metals scheme in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. AmeriFirst Management LLC. Case No. 0:13-cv-
61637-WPD (S.D. Fla.) (see CFTC Press Release 6973-14).

Â¢ In the same action, the court also ordered Grossman clients James Burbage and Frank Gaudino, and their
companies Lloyds Commodities, LLC, Lloyds Commodities Credit Company, LLC, and Lloyds Services, LLC,
to pay restitution totaling over $2 million and civil monetary penalties totaling over $2.9 million for engaging in
unlawful retail off-exchange precious metals transactions (see CFTC Press Release 6850-14).

* Additionally, the CFTC filed and settled charges with two Grossman clients, Secured Precious Metals and
Joseph Glenn Commodities, for engaging in unlawful retail off-exchange precious metals transactions while acting
as metals dealers for Hunter Wise (see CFTC Press Releases 6503-13 and 6542-13).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure that wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Order, entered on April 20, 2018, finds that from at least April 2013 through March 2015, the Defendants devised a
sham commodity pool trading in off-exchange foreign currency (forex) contracts. To solicit pool participants to transfer
funds to them, the Defendants made false statements, fabricated account documents, and established a practice, or
âdemo,â forex trading account that involved no actual funds and posed no risk of loss. The Defendants posted
âprofitableâ trades from the demo account online and falsely represented them to be the Defendantsâ actual trades,
without disclosing that the demo account had sustained âlossesâ exceeding $5 million.

The Court determined that the âDefendants knowingly stole all of the money entrusted to them by spending it on
themselves or passing it to other victims, often within a day of the funds clearing their accounts.â As described in the
Order, Cifuentes and Wee misappropriated pool participantsâ funds by purchasing luxury vehicles, jewelry, and clothing
for themselves. The Defendants also used pool participantsâ funds to make Ponzi scheme-like payments to other victims.

The Order requires the Defendants to pay, on a joint and several basis, $457,120 in restitution to pool participants, as
well as a civil monetary penalty of $1,770,000, plus post-judgment interest on both amounts. As a result of the
âintentional and egregious nature of the Defendantsâ fraudulent conduct,â the Order also permanently bans the
Defendants from the markets the CFTC regulates, and permanently enjoins them from future violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on September 30, 2016 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7463-16),
which charged the Defendants with forex fraud, fraud by a commodity pool operator, and failing to register with the
CFTC.

Related Criminal Action

The U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey has obtained a criminal indictment against Cifuentes and Wee,
charging them with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, four counts of wire fraud, and one count of embezzlement and
theft by a commodity pool operator. United States v. Alcibiades Cifuentes and Jennifer Wee Cifuentes, No. 17-cr-00187-ES
(D.N.J. May 18, 2017). The conspiracy and wire fraud charges each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment
and a $250,000 fine, while the commodity pool operator embezzlement and theft charge carries a maximum penalty of
10 years imprisonment and a $1 million fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense.

CFTC Charges Foreign Trading Platform with Offering Illegal Leveraged Transactions in
Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin

September 28, 2020

Washington, D.C. - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Texas against Laino Group Limited d/b/a PaxForex, a company registered in
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The CFTCâs complaint charges the defendant with engaging in unlawful retail commodity
transactions and failing to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM).

âThis action shows the CFTCâs continued commitment to ensuring that entities offering leveraged, retail transactions
within our jurisdictionâincluding those involving digital assetsâregister with the CFTC,â said Division of Enforcement
Director James McDonald. âWe will vigorously enforce these requirements to preserve market integrity and protect
customers.â

Case Background

According to the complaint, from at least March 2018 to present, PaxForex offered or engaged in unlawful retail
commodity transactions in ether, litecoin, bitcoin, gold, and silver. The defendant violated the CEA by failing to conduct
these transactions subject to the rules of a board of trade that had been designated or registered by the CFTC as a
contract market.

The complaint further alleges that PaxForex, through its employees and agents, acted as an FCM by soliciting and
accepting orders for retail commodity transactions. Additionally, the defendant acted as the counterparty for these
transactions and extended credit or accepted money, securities, and property in the form of bitcoin and other assets in
exchange for margin trades or contracts. Despite acting as an FCM, the defendant failed to register with the CFTC as
required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, restitution,
permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the CEA as charged.

The CFTC strongly urges the public to verify a companyâs registration with the Commission before committing funds. If
unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity. A companyâs registration status can be found
using NFA BASIC.

The CFTC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for
their assistance in this matter.

Devon Malinowski and Salma Mackfrom the CFTCâs Office of Data and Technology also provided assistance in this matter.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Harry E. Wedewer, Christopher Giglio, Candice
Aloisi, Lenel Hickson, and Manal Sultan.

CFTC Charges Florida-Based Oakmont Financial, Inc. and Joseph Charles DiCrisci with
Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil injunctive enforcement action in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Defendants Oakmont Financial, Inc. (Oakmont) of
Boynton Beach, Florida, and Joseph Charles DiCrisci of New York, New York, an Oakmont owner and principal. The
CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals with retail
customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Complaint further alleges that DiCrisci managed, or
controlled those who controlled, the day-to-day operations of Oakmont, and therefore, as controlling person for Oakmont,
is liable for Oakmontâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, from at least July 16, 2011, and continuing through at least July 27, 2012, Oakmont, by and
through its employees, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in leveraged, margined, or financed precious
metals transactions. During that period, Oakmont collected at least $2,308,228 from at least 107 customers in
connection with precious metals transactions and, of this amount, received commissions and fees totaling at least
$735,329. The Complaint also alleges that Oakmont accepted customer orders and funds and therefore acted as a
Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), but failed to register with the CFTC as an FCM, as required.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged, margined, or financed
transactions, such as those conducted by Oakmont, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual
delivery of metals within 28 days. The Complaint alleges that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions made on behalf of Oakmontâs customers.

The Complaint also alleges that Oakmont executed the illegal precious metals transactions through Hunter Wise, LLC
(Hunter Wise). The CFTC filed an enforcement action against Hunter Wise on December 5, 2012, charging it and other
Defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, and charging Hunter Wise with fraud and
other violations (see CFTC Press Releases 6447-12).

On February 19, 2014, the court found, on summary judgment, that Hunter Wise had no actual metal to deliver to
customers and held that Hunter Wise engaged in illegal precious metals transactions and was required to register as an
FCM but did not do so and therefore violated Sections 4(a) and 4d of the CEA (see CFTC v. Hunter Wise Commodities,
LLC, 1 F. Supp. 3d 1311 (S.D. Fla. 2014)). On April 15, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed
the courtâs issuance of a preliminary injunction and held that the CFTCâs jurisdiction under Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the CEA
extends to the precious metals transactions at issue in the case and that no exception to the CFTCâs jurisdiction applied.
And, on May 16, 2014, after a bench trial on the remaining claims, including fraud, the court entered an Order finding
that Hunter Wise fraudulently misrepresented the nature of precious metals transactions that resulted in millions of
dollars in customer losses (See CFTC Press Release 6935-14, May 22, 2014, CFTC Wins Fraud Trial against Hunter Wise
Related Precious Metals Firms and Their Owners).

In its continuing litigation against Oakmont and DiCrisci, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary
penalties, restitution to affected customers, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from
future violations of the CEA, as charged.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are: Kara Mucha, Kassra Goudarzi, Michael
Solinsky, and Charles Marvine.

Federal Court Orders Florida Company to Pay More Than $15 Million in Monetary
Sanctions for Fraud and Illegal Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida entered a default judgment against defendants Aviv Michael Hen of New York, and Omega
Knight 2, LLC, as well as a consent order against Erez Hen of Florida, for fraud and illegal, off-exchange precious
metals transactions and failing to register with the CFTC.

The courtâs default judgment requires defendants Omega Knight and Aviv Hen to pay a civil monetary penalty of
$11,442,771, pay $3,814,257 in disgorgement, and imposes permanent registration and trading bans against them. The
courtâs consent order requires Erez Hen to pay a civil monetary penalty of $75,000, pay $275,000 in disgorgement, and
imposes five-year registration and trading ban against him, and requires him to comply with certain undertakings
involving two Erez Hen-owned entities unrelated to Omega Knight.

The judgment and consent order resolve a CFTC enforcement case filed on June 13, 2018 [See CFTC Press Release 7740-
18], charging the defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions.

In its motion for default judgment, the CFTC presented evidence that from March 2013 through June 2017, Omega Knight,
including Aviv Hen, engaged in a scheme to defraud customers located throughout the United States in connection with
precious metals transactions. According to the default order, the defendants made numerous false statements to induce
customers to enter into leveraged and fully-paid precious metals transactions, and Omega Knight received a minimum of
$5.5 million from at least 90 customers in connection with these transactions.

The default order found that Omega Knight failed to use all of the customer funds it collected to purchase metal for its
customersâ precious metals transactions. Instead, Omega Knight and Aviv Hen misappropriated customer funds to pay
personal expenses, to distribute purported âprofitsâ and disbursements to other customers, and to fund Omega Knightâs
operations. Through the issuance of false trade confirmations, account statements, and other communications to
customers, Omega Knight and Aviv Hen concealed their misappropriation and fraudulent scheme.

Moreover, the default order found that Omega Knightâs leveraged or financed precious metals transactions constituted
illegal, off-exchange retail commodity transactions. Notably, Omega Knight's leveraged or financed precious metals
transactions never resulted in actual delivery of the full amount of metal purchased to customers. In addition, the default
order found that Omega Knight accepted customer orders and funds in connection with those transactions and therefore
acted as a futures commission merchant without being registered as required.

The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Patricia Gomersall, Jason Wright, Kassra
Goudarzi, Hillary Van Tassel, A. Daniel Ullman II, and Paul G. Hayeck.

Federal Court in Ohio Orders over $31 Million in Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalties
against John R. Bullar and His Company, Executive Management Advisors L.L.C., for
Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor Fraud and Ponzi Scheme

In a Related Criminal Action, John R. Bullar was sentenced to 8 Years 4
Months in Prison and Ordered to Pay over $6 Million in Criminal
Restitution

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Michael R.
Barrett of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered an Order for Final Judgment by Default against
Defendant John R. Bullar, a resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, and a Consent Order against his company, Defendant
Executive Management Advisors L.L.C. (EMA), imposing restitution on Bullar and EMA of over $6.2 million. In
addition, the Orders require Bullar and EMA to pay civil monetary penalties totaling more than $24.8 million for their
fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement, and operation of a Ponzi scheme, while illegally acting as Commodity Trading
Advisors (CTAs) and Commodity Pool Operators (CPOs) without registering as such with the CFTC. The Orders also
impose permanent trading and registration bans on the Defendants and prohibit them from further violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Orders arise out of a CFTC Complaint filed on September 23, 2014, which charged Bullar and EMA with
embezzlement, fraudulent solicitation, misappropriation of customer funds, fraud by a CPO and CTA, commodity futures
and options fraud, and failure to register as a CPO and CTA (see Complaint and Press Release 7006-14, September 23,
2014).

Embezzlement and Misappropriation

The Orders find that Bullar, from at least January 2008, and EMA, from at least March 2009 through September 2013,
fraudulently solicited and accepted at least $8.3 million from at least 40 investors (EMA Pool Participants), who were told
their funds would be pooled and traded in commodity futures and option contracts. In fact, according to the Orders, most
of the funds received from the EMA Pool Participants were not traded at all, and over $6.2 million of the EMA Pool
Participantsâ funds were embezzled or misappropriated by the Defendants and used by Bullar to pay his personal
expenses, to pay money to him or to accounts he controlled, and to purchase property, vehicles, landscaping and other
home improvements. Additionally, some EMA Pool Participantsâ funds were used by Defendants to pay for other EMA
Pool Participantsâ withdrawals of principal or fictitious profits, in the manner typical of a Ponzi scheme, the Orders find.

The Orders further find that to conceal their embezzlement and fraud the Defendants issued false account statements
that showed fictitious profits and account balances and other false information. Throughout the periods of their
misconduct, Bullar and EMA failed to register with the CFTC as a CPO or CTA, as required, the Orders find.

Related Criminal Action

In a related criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Ohio, Bullar pleaded guilty to
one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering and was sentenced on June 22, 2015 to 100 months (8 years
and 4 months) in prison and ordered to pay criminal restitution totaling over $6 million.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Ohio, the
Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (Cincinnati Field Office), the Ohio Department of Commerce (Division of
Securities-Enforcement), and the Office of the Hamilton County Prosecutorâs Office.

Bullar and His Company, Executive Management Advisors L.L.C., for. Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor Fraud and Ponzi Scheme. In a Related Criminal Action, John R. Bullar was sentenced to 8 Years 4. Months in Prison and Ordered to Pay over $6 Million in Criminal. Restitution.","Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Michael R.
 Barrett of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered an Order for Final Judgment by Default against Defendant John R. Bullar, a resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, and a Consent Order against his company, Defendant Executive Management Advisors L.L.C. (EMA), imposing restitution on Bullar and EMA of over $6.2 million. In addition, the Orders require Bullar and EMA to pay civil monetary penalties totaling more than $24.8 million for their fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement, and operation of a Ponzi scheme, while illegally acting as Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) and Commodity Pool Operators (CPOs) without registering as such with the CFTC. The Orders also impose permanent trading and registration bans on the Defendants and prohibit them from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Orders arise out of a CFTC Complaint filed on September 23, 2014, which charged Bullar and EMA with embezzlement, fraudulent solicitation, misappropriation of customer funds, fraud by a CPO and CTA, commodity futures and options fraud, and failure to register as a CPO and CTA (see Complaint and Press Release 7006-14, September 23, 2014).

Embezzlement and Misappropriation
The Orders find that Bullar, from at least January 2008, and EMA, from at least March 2009 through September 2013, fraudulently solicited and accepted at least $8.3 million from at least 40 investors (EMA Pool Participants), who were told their funds would be pooled and traded in commodity futures and option contracts. In fact, according to the Orders, most of the funds received from the EMA Pool Participants were not traded at all, and over $6.2 million of the EMA Pool Participants’ funds were embezzled or misappropriated by the Defendants and used by Bullar to pay his personal expenses, to pay money to him or to accounts he controlled, and to purchase property, vehicles, landscaping and other home improvements. Additionally, some EMA Pool Participants’ funds were used by Defendants to pay for other EMA Pool Participants’ withdrawals of principal or fictitious profits, in the manner typical of a Ponzi scheme, the Orders find.

The Orders further find that to conceal their embezzlement and fraud the Defendants issued false account statements that showed fictitious profits and account balances and other false information. Throughout the periods of their misconduct, Bullar and EMA failed to register with the CFTC as a CPO or CTA, as required, the Orders find.

Related Criminal Action
In a related criminal action brought by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio, Bullar pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering and was sentenced on June 22, 2015 to 100 months (8 years and 4 months) in prison and ordered to pay criminal restitution totaling over $6 million.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (Cincinnati Field Office), the Ohio Department of Commerce (Division of Securities-Enforcement), and the Office of the Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office.

Federal Court Orders Cindy and Paul Vandivier to Pay Civil Monetary Penalties and
Restitution of Almost $3 Million to Settle CFTC Charges of Operating an Illegal, Off-
Exchange Precious Metals Scheme

The Vandiviers Were also Charged with Misappropriating Virtually All of
Customer Funds, Using the Money for Office and Personal Expenses

Washington, DC -- The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) obtained a federal court Consent Order
imposing a permanent injunction against CFTC Defendants Cindy Vandivier and Paul Vandivier of Coconut Creek,
Florida. The Courtâs Order requires the Vandiviers to each pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty and jointly to pay
$986,763 in restitution to defrauded customers to settle CFTC charges of fraudulently soliciting customers and
misappropriating customer funds in connection with illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals. Cindy Vandivier
is the wife of Paul Vandivier.

The Order, entered on February 5, 2016, by Judge William J. Zloch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida, also imposes permanent trading and registration bans on the Vandiviers and prohibits them from further
violations of the anti-fraud and off-exchange trading provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as
charged.

The Order arises out of a CFTC Complaint filed on May 12, 2014. The Complaint charged the Vandiviers and their
company, Mintline, Inc., with fraudulently soliciting retail customers and misappropriating customer funds in connection
with illegal, off-exchange transactions in precious metals, from July 2011 to at least April 2013 (see CFTC Complaint and
Press Release 6934-14). The CFTCâs litigation against Mintline is still ongoing, as Mintline is currently in default in this
action, awaiting the entry of a default Order by the Court.

According to the Order, the Vandiviers, through Mintline, solicited retail customers throughout the United States to
purchase physical metals on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. The Order finds, however, that contrary to what
customers were led to believe, the Vandiviers did not purchase, sell, transfer ownership of, deliver, or arrange for storage
of any physical metals in connection with the financed metals transactions. Instead, according to the Order, they
misappropriated most, if not all, of customersâ funds to pay Mintlineâs operating expenses and to pay for personal
expenses, including animal, automobile, communication, employee, medical, and shopping expenses. As a result of the
Vandiviersâ fraudulent activities, Mintlineâs customers lost a total of $986,763, according to the Order.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Charges 10 Commodity Trading Advisors for Failing to Maintain NFA Memberships

September 03, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced the filing of charges against 10
commodity trading advisors (CTAs) for failing to obtain and maintain membership in a registered futures association
(RFA) as required by CFTC regulations. Compliance with this provision necessarily requires all registered CTAs to maintain
membership in the National Futures Association (NFA), which is the only RFA currently registered with the CFTC.

The 10 respondents named in the CFTCâs complaints are: Adale LLC, a California limited liability corporation; Amgad
Gayed Attia, a New York resident; Obie Lee Cole, an lowa resident; CWE USA LLC, a California limited liability
corporation; Suanne Fay Goldman, an Illinois resident; Griggs Research & Consulting Inc., an Indiana corporation;
JPR Inc., a Maryland corporation; Lewis Futures Management LLC, a Georgia limited liability corporation; McClelland
Capital Management Inc., a New York corporation; and Weiliang Shao, a Nevada resident.

âAs the sole registered futures association, NFA plays a critical role in the oversight of CFTC registrants,â said Division of
Enforcement Director James McDonald. âBut NFA can only do its part if registrants submit to its jurisdictional
requirements. Where registrants seek to skirt those rules, the CFTC will act to ensure compliance and to preserve NFAâs
ability to carry out its important oversight function. Our derivatives markets are better served, and the public is better
protected, by these important requirements.â

Case Background

The complaints charge that the respondents, though registered as CTAs, are violating CFTC Regulation 170.17, which
requires that every registered CTA, unless eligible for certain exemptions, must become and remain a member of at least
one RFA.

By failing to maintain membership with the NFA or assert a valid exemption from NFA membership, the respondents have
improperly avoided NFAâs industry self-regulation. The NFA is responsible, with CFTC oversight, for certain aspects of the
regulation of CTAs and other futures entities, including examining CTAsâ qualifications and proficiency, financial
condition, retail sales practices, and business conduct. Because the respondents have not maintained their membership
with NFA, it has had no jurisdiction to perform its vital self-regulatory functions with respect to the respondents.

In its enforcement action, the CFTC seeks an order directing the respondents to cease and desist from violating the
provision requiring membership in an RFA.

The CFTC thanks NFA for its cooperation and assistance.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Douglas Snodgrass, Elizabeth N. Pendleton, Scott R.
Williamson, Joan Manley, and Robert T. Howell.

CFTC Charges New York Man in Multi-Million Dollar Digital Asset Ponzi Scheme Involving
Bitcoin and Ether

January 26, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed a federal civil enforcement action in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York charging Jeremy Spence of New York, with fraud for operating a
Ponzi scheme involving digital assets such as bitcoin and ether in which he fraudulently solicited more than $5 million of
investments from individuals. The Division of Enforcementâs Digital Assets Task Force was involved in this case.

âFraudulent schemes, like that alleged in this case, undermine the integrity and development of digital asset markets
and cheat customers out of their hard-earned money,â said Acting Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle. âWe will
continue to work to protect participants in our markets from fraudulent practices and hold fraudsters accountable.â

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and
registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
regulations, as charged.

Related Criminal Action

Earlier today Spence was charged by federal criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New
York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Case Background

The complaint alleges that Spence, at times operating as âCoin Signals,â ran a Ponzi scheme in which he fraudulently
solicited and obtained digital assets such as bitcoin and ether worth more than $5 million from customers. According to
the complaint, Spenceâs trading resulted in significant trading losses and, as in all Ponzi schemes, his payouts of
supposed profits to customers in actuality consisted of other customersâ misappropriated funds. Spence allegedly
engaged in numerous efforts to conceal his misconduct, including misrepresenting his trading profitability and the
amount of assets he had under management, misappropriating customer funds, and issuing false performance
statements. As stated in the complaint, Spence eventually admitted to his customers that he had engaged in âlies and
deceit.â

LLC, with off-exchange, leveraged or margined retail foreign currency (forex) fraud, commodity pool fraud, and failing to
register with the CFTC.

According to the CFTCâs Complaint, from at least April 2013 through March 2015, Cifuentes and Wee fraudulently
solicited approximately $590,000 from members of the public to participate in a supposed commodity pool that traded
leveraged or margined retail off-exchange forex contracts. The Complaint states that Cifuentes and Wee knowingly made
material misrepresentations and omissions concerning their forex trading strategies and profits, including falsely
representing that fictitious, profitable forex trades selected from a demonstration account reflected Defendantsâ actual
trades.

Misappropriation of Pool Participantsâ Funds

As the Complaint alleges, Cifuentes and Wee misappropriated all or most of pool participantsâ funds and used them to
purchase luxury vehicles, jewelry, and clothing for themselves, among other items. The Complaint states that Cifuentes
and Wee also diverted a portion of pool participantsâ deposits to other victims as âdividendsâ in the manner of a Ponzi
scheme.

The Complaint further alleges that, in order to conceal their fraudulent scheme, Defendants issued falsified account
statements to pool participants that reflected account balances and dividend payments that did not exist.

In its continuing litigation against the Defendants, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants,
disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent
injunction against future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

Federal Court Orders Husband and Wife Team and Their Company to Pay Defrauded
Customers More Than $1 Million in Connection with a Futures Trading Scheme

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that on December 27, 2018 a
Washington State federal court ordered Bellevue, Washington residents Sung Hong a/k/a Lawrence Hong or
Laurence Hong, his wife, Hyun Joo Hong a/k/a/ Grace Hong, and their company Pishon Holding LLC to pay more
than $1.25 million in restitution in connection with an enforcement action brought by the CFTC charging the defendants
with fraudulent solicitation and misappropriation involving futures contracts. In addition to the restitution, the Court
Order also imposes a permanent trading and registration ban on the Hongs and Pishon and prohibits them from violating
provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) as charged.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on June 1, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of
Washington. [See CFTC Press Release 7569-17]. In the Order, Judge Marsha Pechman found that the Hongs and Pishon
misappropriated $1,259,317.77 from their customers. Additionally, the court found that the Hongs and Pishon
fraudulently solicited more than $11 million dollars from customers for the purpose of trading futures contacts. The court
further found that the Hongs and Pishon lied about, about among other things how much money they had under
management; Laurence Hongâs prior trading success; and how trading fees would be deducted from customer accounts.
At the same time, the Court Order found, the Hongs and Pishon failed to tell customers that Laurence Hong had been
imprisoned previously for 33 months in connection with wire fraud charges.

In a parallel criminal case filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, Laurence Hong
and Grace Hong pleaded guilty on March 27, 2018 and March 30, 2018, respectively, to multiple criminal counts. See
Case No. CR17-163TSZ. On October 11, 2018, Laurence Hong was sentenced to a 180-month prison term and Grace
Hong was sentenced to a 72-month prison term. The court ordered that the defendants also pay restitution in the
criminal matter. In recognition of the prior restitution award in the criminal matter, Judge Pechman ordered that the
defendants may offset their civil restitution obligation with payments in the criminal matter on a one-to-one basis.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement thanks the United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington and the FBI for
their invaluable assistance and cooperation.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Kevin Samuel, Ilana Waxman, Kim Bruno,
Alison Wilson, and Rick Glaser.

CFTC Charges Randall Crater, Mark Gillespie, and My Big Coin Pay, Inc. with Fraud and
Misappropriation in Ongoing Virtual Currency Scam

Defendants allegedly solicited more than $6 million for investments in a virtual currency
known as âMy Big Coinâ

Federal court issues restraining Order freezing Defendantsâ and Relief Defendantsâ assets
and protecting books and records

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a federal court
enforcement action under seal on January 16, 2018, charging commodity fraud and misappropriation related to the
ongoing solicitation of customers for a virtual currency Known as My Big Coin (MBC). The CFTC Complaint charges
Defendants Randall Crater of East Hampton, New York, Mark Gillespie of Hartland, Michigan, and My Big Coin Pay,
Inc., a corporation based in Las Vegas, Nevada, with misappropriating over $6 million from customers by, among other
things, transferring customer funds into personal bank accounts, and using those funds for personal expenses and the
purchase of luxury goods.

On January 16, 2018, Judge Rya Zobel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, issued a restraining
Order, also under seal, freezing the Defendantsâ assets. The Order also freezes the assets of Relief Defendants Kimberly
Renee Benge, Kimberly Renee Benge d/b/a Greyshore Advertisement a/k/a Greyshore Advertiset, Barbara Crater
Meeks, Erica Crater, Greyshore, LLC, and Greyshore Technology, LLC for allegedly receiving customer funds
without providing any legitimate services to clients and without any interest or entitlement to such customer funds. The
courtâs restraining Order also prohibits the Defendants and Relief Defendants from destroying or altering books and
records.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

Director of Enforcement James McDonald, stated: âAs this case shows, the CFTC is actively policing the virtual currency
markets and will vigorously enforce the anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act. In addition to harming
customers, fraud in connection with virtual currencies inhibits potentially market-enhancing developments in this area.
We caution potential virtual currency customers, once again, that they should engage in appropriate diligence before
purchasing virtual currencies.â

Specifically, the CFTC Complaint alleges that from at least January 2014 through January 2018, the Defendants
fraudulently solicited potential and existing MBC customers throughout the United States by making false and misleading
claims and omissions about MBCâs value, usage, and trade status, and that MBC was backed by gold. Defendants also
allegedly fraudulently solicited numerous customers in the District of Massachusetts, receiving in excess of $5 million
from those customers.

As alleged in the Complaint, the MBC website, maintained and operated by the Defendants, conveyed to customers
numerous solicitation materials, MBC trade data, and other materials (1) misrepresenting that MBC was actively being
traded on several currency exchanges, including the MBC Exchange website, when in fact it was not; (2) misrepresenting
in reports the daily trading price, when in fact no price existed because MBC was not trading; (3) misrepresenting that
MBC was backed by gold, when in fact it was not; and (4) misrepresenting that MBC had partnered with MasterCard, with
the promise that MBC could be used anywhere MasterCard was accepted, when in fact no such partnership existed and
MBC could not be used anywhere MasterCard was accepted. In reality, as alleged, the supposed trading results were
illusory, and any payouts to customers were derived from funds fraudulently obtained from other customers in the
manner of a Ponzi scheme.

As customers began to raise questions about their MBC accounts, Defendants attempted to conceal their fraud by issuing
additional coins to customers and falsely representing that they had secured a deal with another exchange to trade MBC,
according to the Complaint. Defendants allegedly encouraged customers to refrain from redeeming their MBC holdings
until MBC was active on this ânewâ exchange.

Misappropriated Funds Used for Personal Purchases, Including a Home, Jewelry & Travel

As further alleged in the Complaint, Defendants misappropriated virtually all of the approximately $6 million they
solicited from customers. Defendants allegedly used these misappropriated funds to purchase a home, antiques, fine art,
jewelry, luxury goods, furniture, interior decorating and other home improvement services, travel, and entertainment.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, restitution, rescission, disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains, trading and registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal commodities
laws, as charged.

This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Virtual Currency Task Force, and CFTC staff
members responsible for this case are Traci Rodriguez, Patricia Gomersall, Jonah McCarthy, Jason Mahoney, Hillary Van
Tassel, John Einstman and Paul Hayeck.

CFTC Charges Matthew J. Marcus and His California Company, Tech Power, Inc., and John
D. Briner and His Canadian Law Firm, MetroWest Law Corp., with a Money Pass Scheme
Involving More than 1,200 Single Stock Futures Trades

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it filed a civil
enforcement action in federal court in Chicago against Matthew J. Marcus of California and his company, Tech Power,
Inc. (Tech Power), a Nevada corporation located in California, and John D. Briner, an attorney residing in Vancouver,
Canada, and his company, MetroWest Law Corporation (MetroWest), a Canadian law firm. The CFTC Complaint
charges the four Defendants with engaging in fictitious single stock futures transactions on OneChicago LLC
(OneChicago) and trading non-competitively.

On April 16, 2015, the Honorable Milton Shadur of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a
restraining Order freezing certain assets and prohibiting the Defendants from destroying documents.

The CFTC Complaint alleges that over seven consecutive trading days from January 28, 2014 to February 5, 2014, the
Defendants engaged in 624 round-turn trades between an account carried in the name of MetroWest and an account
carried in the name of Tech Power involving 1,248 perfectly matched pre-arranged, non-competitive transactions in
single stock futures contracts listed on OneChicago. By structuring the transactions in this way, the Defendants allegedly
were able to ensure that MetroWest would trade with Tech Power and that Tech Power would always profit from the
transactions. According to the Complaint, through these transactions, the Defendants conducted a âmoney passâ
between the two accounts and moved at least $390,000 from MetroWest to Tech Power. Defendants carried out their
scheme on OneChicago using two trading accounts held at the same CFTC-registered futures commission merchant.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading and
registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The CFTC thanks OneChicago for its assistance.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Lindsey Evans, Diane Romaniuk, Heather
Johnson, Melissa Glasbrenner, Robert Howell, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Orders Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC to Pay $5 Million for Swap Data
Reporting Failures

September 30, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that it has filed and settled charges
against Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC, a provisionally registered swap dealer, for failing to comply with swap
data reporting obligations.

The order requires Morgan Stanley to pay a $5 million civil monetary penalty and to retain a qualified outside consultant
to verify its remediation of the root causes of the 29 swap data violations set forth in the order.

âThis case demonstrates once again the importance of complying with the CFTCâs swap data reporting requirements,â
said Division of Enforcement Director James McDonald. âThe CFTC will continue to scrutinize closely entities that do not
meet their reporting obligations and, as appropriate, will continue to bring cases in this area.â

Case Background

The order finds that since December 31, 2012, Morgan Stanley inaccurately reported swap data for at least
approximately 3 million swaps, as required under Section 2(a)(13)(F) and (G) of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations 43.3(a), 45.3, 45.4, 45.5, and 45.6. The errors included, among others, failures to report accurate primary
economic terms data fields, including: Legal Entity Identifier, Unique Swap Identifier, notional amount, execution venue
LEI, and price notation. In addition, Morgan Stanley reported nearly half of its swaps for one asset class outside of the
time parameters required by CFTC Regulation Part 43.

The order recognizes Morgan Stanleyâs cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs investigation in the form of a
reduced civil monetary penalty.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the National Futures Association in this matter. Thomas Guerin,
David Aron, and Meghan Tente from the Division of Market Oversight, as well as Robert Stowsky from the Office of Data
and Technology, also assisted with this case.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Amanda Burks, Philip Tumminio, Kara Mucha,
Erica Bodin, James H. Holl, Ill, and Rick Glaser.

CFTC Orders Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. to Pay Approximately $25 Million for
Spoofing, Manipulation, and Attempted Manipulation in Precious Metals Futures

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. (MLCI), a provisionally registered swap dealer, for spoofing,
manipulation, and attempted manipulation over a six-year period with respect to certain precious metals futures
contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX).

The CFTC Order imposes monetary sanctions totaling approximately $25 million, which includes a civil monetary penalty
of $11.5 million dollars, over $2.3 million in restitution, and disgorgement of $11.1 million. The Order also requires MLCI
to cooperate with the CFTC in matters related to this action and the underlying conduct, and to comply with certain
obligations in connection with its corporate compliance program and reporting requirements.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, stated: âTodayâs enforcement action shows that the Commission
continues to aggressively pursue those who manipulate and spoof in our markets. If left unchecked, this sort of
misconduct can undermine the integrity of the price discovery process, harm law-abiding market participants, and
diminish confidence in our markets more generally. Thatâs why we will continue to keep our markets free from spoofing
and manipulation.â

The Order specifically finds that during the period from at least 2008 through 2014 certain traders at MLCI (Traders)
placed orders to buy and sell precious metals futures contracts with the intent to cancel the orders before execution.
According to the Order, the Tradersâ spoofing strategy frequently involved placing a relatively small bid or offer with the
intent to execute that order (the Genuine Order) and, prior to the execution of the Genuine Order, placing a larger order
(or multiple orders) on the opposite side of the same market with the intent to cancel the order or orders before
execution (the Spoof Order). Generally, the Traders would receive a partial or complete fill of the Genuine Order and
cancel the Spoof Order before it was filled. The Order further finds that the Traders engaged in this conduct with the
intent to manipulate market prices and ultimately did cause artificial prices. Moreover, as the Order finds, on occasion,
certain Traders acknowledged spoofing to affect prices. For example, in a November 16, 2010 electronic chat, a Trader
stated:

âguys the algos are really geared up in here. [I]f you spoof this it really moves... .â
The Order recognizes that MLCI provided substantial cooperation to CFTCâs Division of Enforcement which resulted in a
substantially reduced civil monetary penalty.

Today, the US Department of Justice also announced that the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division has entered into a
Non-Prosecution Agreement with MLCI in a parallel matter. Under the terms of the agreement, MLCI has agreed, among
other things, to pay $25 million, which represents the combined appropriate criminal fine, forfeiture, and restitution
amounts in that matter, to cooperate fully with the Fraud Section in any and all matters relating to the underlying
conduct, and to comply with certain obligations in connection with its corporate compliance program and reporting
requirements.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members
responsible for this matter are Brandon Wozniak, Lara Turcik, Candice Aloisi, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Orders BNP Paribas to Pay $90 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation and False
Reporting of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an Order today filing and settling charges
against BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (BNP Paribas or the Bank) for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark
and requiring BNP Paribas to pay a $90 million civil monetary penalty. BNP Paribasâ principal office is located in New
York, New York.

The CFTC Order finds that over a five-year period, beginning in or about May 2007 and continuing through at least August
2012 (the Relevant Period), BNP Paribas attempted to manipulate the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives
Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a leading global benchmark referenced in a range of interest rate products, to benefit BNP
Paribasâs derivatives positions in instruments such as cash-settled options on interest rate swaps and certain exotic
structured products. BNP Paribasâs unlawful conduct involved multiple traders and included supervisors, the Order finds.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: âThis matter, the seventh enforcement action relating to
the USD ISDAFIX benchmark, further demonstrates that the CFTC will continue to be vigilant and aggressive in protecting
the integrity of our markets. And we won't stop until all wrongdoers are held accountableâno matter how broadly the
misconduct stretches across the industry.â

During the Relevant Period, the USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with
the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S. based unit of a leading interest rate swaps brokering
firm (Swaps Broker). ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing mid-market
rate, at a specific time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. They are issued in
several currencies and are published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The most widely used USD
ISDAFIX rates and spreads, and the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing
market rate as of 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX rate was used for the cash settlement of options
on interest rate swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for a wide range of products across financial markets.

In addition to the $90 million civil monetary penalty, the Order requires BNP Paribas to cease and desist from further
violations as charged, and take specified remedial steps, including measures to detect and deter trading intended to
manipulate swap rates such as the USD ISDAFIX, to ensure the integrity and reliability of the Bankâs benchmark
submissions, and to improve related internal controls.

The Order finds that BNP Paribas, through its traders, bid, offered, and executed transactions in interest rate swap
spreads in a manner deliberately designedâin timing, price, and other respectsâto influence the published USD ISDAFIX
in order to benefit the Bank in its derivatives positions. In addition, the Order finds that BNP Paribas, through its
employees making the Bankâs USD ISDAFIX submissions, also attempted to manipulate and made false reports
concerning the USD ISDAFIX by skewing the Bankâs submissions in order to benefit the Bank at the expense of its
derivatives counterparties and clients.

Attempts to Manipulate Through Trading

According to the Order, BNP Paribas traders attempted to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX by bidding, offering, and
executing transactions of swap spreads at the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time in order to affect the âprint,â i.e., the
reference rates captured at 11:00 a.m. and sent to submitting banks, and thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX.
Contemporaneous communications reveal that BNPP traders explicitly coordinated their efforts to manipulate the 11:00
a.m. USD ISDAFIX in accordance with the preferences expressed by BNPP options traders in order to benefit the option
tradersâ settlements of basic vanilla swaptions as well as their complex derivatives positions related to the periodic resets
and settlements of exotic constant maturity swaps (CMS) products.

As found in the Order, BNPP traders recognized that â1llam print manipulationâ could present both risks and
opportunities for the bank, including for sophisticated exotics positions that the options desk held, such as correlation
and volatility swaps. Certain BNPP traders described such attempts to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX as ways to âplay the
fixing,â âpush the screen,â and âplay[] the screen game.â As found in the Order, the communications among BNPP
traders could be explicit, such as when a swaps trader confirmed in all-capitals to an options trader: âok you need the
fixing to be AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE,â or when an options trader stated to a group of BNPP traders, âat 1lam we want to fix
as low as possible.â On one occasion, BNPP options and swaps traders likened their illegal efforts to manipulate the USD
ISDAFIX to lyrics of popular songs by Montell Jordan and Salt-N-Pepa:

my

e BNPP Options Trader: thatâs a great fixing
e BNPP Swaps Trader: this is how we do it here :-P
e BNPP Options Trader: push it real good

To move the USD ISDAFIX in the direction or directions desired by the options desk, BNPP swaps traders strategized with
Swaps Broker employees to accomplish the tradersâ goals. For example, BNPP swaps traders discussed with Swaps
Broker employees the tradersâ intention to accomplish certain swap spread screen prints or directional moves at 11:00
a.m., rather than a desire to buy or sell a specific amount of swap spreads, and, as shown in contemporaneous
communications, âthe easiest way to accomplish the screen printâ or directional move. To affect the USD ISDAFIX print
more effectively and at minimal cost, BNPP swaps traders also typically timed their trading activity to try to be the last
screen-moving event before the 11:00 a.m. print.

Attempts to Manipulate Through False Reporting
To complement these manipulative efforts, as found in the Order, on certain occasions during the Relevant Period BNP
Paribas traders attempted to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX by making USD ISDAFIX submissions higher or lower for the
purpose of benefitting derivative positions priced or valued against the benchmark. As the Order finds, these
submissions by BNP Paribas were false, misleading, or Knowingly inaccurate because they did not report where BNP
Paribas would itself bid and offer swaps absent a desire to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that
were more favorable to the Bankâs specific derivatives positions. Multiple BNPP Options Desk traders engaged in
communications about USD ISDAFIX submissions with BNPP Swaps Desk traders, and supervisors on the Swaps Desk and
Options Desk were aware of such requests and their connection to swaption cash settlements and/or CMS resets.

The Order describes multiple examples of these strategies for attempted manipulation and false reporting by BNP Paribas
traders during the Relevant Period.

In accepting the Bankâs Offer, the Commission recognizes BNP Paribasâs cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs
investigation. The Order notes BNP Paribasâs significant cooperation during the Division of Enforcementâs investigation of
this matter and recognizes that BNPP provided important information to the Division that helped the Division efficiently
and effectively to undertake its investigation. The Order also states that BNPP commenced significant remedial action to
improve internal controls and policies related to all benchmarks, including ISDAFIX and its successor benchmark,
independent of the Commissionâs investigation.

Federal Court Permanently Enjoins Defendants and Orders Them to Pay Penalties and
Restitution for Bitcoin Solicitation Fraud, Impersonating a CFTC Investigator, and Sending
Forged CFTC Documents

Washington, DC - On June 28, 2019, a Texas federal court ordered two defendantsâone using the name Morgan Hunt
(Hunt), purportedly of Arlington, Texas (Hunt), and the other using the name Kim Hecroft (Hecroft), purportedly of Baltimore,
Maryland (together, Defendants)âto pay nearly $400,000 in civil monetary penalties and restitution in connection with a
lawsuit alleging fraud brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

In an Order and Default Judgment (Order) filed June 28, 2019, Judge Reed C. OâConnor of the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Texas found that Hunt, doing business as Diamonds Trading Investment House, and Hecroft, doing
business as First Options Trading, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to solicit Bitcoin from members of the public to invest in
trading products including leveraged or margined foreign currency contracts (forex), binary options, and diamonds.

The Order found that between January 2017 and the filing of the CFTC Complaint on September 28, 2018 (see CFTC Complaint
and Press Release 7813-18), Defendants used Facebook and email to fraudulently solicit Bitcoin from members of the public,
falsely claimed that they would use customer funds to invest in trading for the benefit of the customers, misrepresented their
experience and track record as traders and portfolio managers, falsely told customers that they could not withdraw their
purported investment profits without first paying a tax to the CFTC, and misappropriated customer funds. Defendantsâ
fraudulent actions included providing fake account statements, impersonating a CFTC investigator, and sending forged
documents purportedly authored by the CFTCâs General Counsel and bearing the image of the CFTCâs official seal.

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: âAs the CFTC has repeatedly warned, retail customers should
exercise caution before buying or trading cryptocurrencies on unfamiliar Internet websites or social media. The CFTC
reiterates that it does not collect taxes or fees, and will continue to educate the investing public and aggressively pursue
misconduct in this arena.â

The Order requires Hunt to pay restitution and a $180,000 civil monetary penalty, and requires Hecroft to pay restitution and
a $180,000 civil monetary penalty. In addition, the Order imposes permanent trading and registration bans on Defendants,
and permanently enjoins them from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection
of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

Federal Court in North Carolina Orders Tracy Lee Thomas and His Company, Marbury
Advisors Inc., to Pay More than $4.4 Million for Fraudulently Soliciting Customers

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Judge Loretta C. Biggs of
the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina entered an Order of Final Judgment by Default (Order)
against Defendants Tracy Lee Thomas (a/k/a Treyton L. Thomas, a/k/a Trayton L. Thomas, a/k/a Trey Thomas, a/k/a
Tray Thomas, a/k/a T.L. Thomas), formerly of Naples, Florida, and Marbury Advisors Inc. (Marbury), a Cayman Islands
corporation. The Courtâs Order finds that the Defendants had fraudulently solicited over $ 1.1 million from customers, lost
those funds trading, and provided customers with false reports or statements indicating their investments were
profitable.

The Courtâs Order, entered on April 11, 2017 and stemming from a CFTC complaint filed March 22, 2016 (see CFTC
Complaint and Press Release 7348-16), requires Thomas and Marbury, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of
$1,110,413 and a civil monetary penalty of $3,331,239, which represents triple the monetary gain to Defendants. The
Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans and prohibits Defendants from further violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Courtâs Order finds that between February 2011 and August 2012, Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme by
soliciting approximately $1,189,000 from customers by misrepresenting they would invest in Treasury Bills on customersâ
behalf, misrepresenting Defendantsâ prior investment and trading success, and misrepresenting that Thomas, who was a
Managing Director of Marbury, would invest in a conservative manner. The Order also finds that Defendants failed to
disclose that they used customersâ funds to trade Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-mini S&P 500 futures contracts, and
Chicago Board of Trade 2-Year Treasury Note futures contracts.

According to the Order, Defendants also failed to disclose 1) the substantial risk of loss associated with futures trading,
and 2) the net losses Defendants sustained while trading futures.

Further, according to the Order, Thomas solicited his father-in-law by falsely representing that the Defendants were
successful in their prior business and trading activities and the funds would be used to invest in âsafeâ and
âconservativeâ T-Bills. The Order found that Thomasâ father-in-law made several investments with Defendants, wiring an
approximate total of $594,000 to an account controlled by Thomas and which he used to trade commodity futures
without disclosing this fact. The Order also finds that Defendants attempted to conceal their fraudulent conduct by
providing fabricated account statements to customers and to a bank where Thomas controlled a trust account owned by
his late father.

On November 22, 2016, in a related on-going matter, Thomas was indicted for fourteen counts of wire fraud in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (see U.S. v. Thomas, case no. 16-CR-298).

The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority for its assistance.

CFTC Orders SG Americas Securities, LLC to Pay a $750,000 Civil Monetary Penalty for its
Participation in Wash Transactions and Related Supervision Failures

CFTC Finds that the Firm Lacked Adequate Controls and Procedures to
Detect and Prevent the Execution of Unlawful Wash Exchange of
Futures for Physical Transactions

SG Americas Securities, LLC is the successor to Newedge USA, LLC

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against SG Americas Securities, LLC, as successor to Newedge USA, LLC
(Newedge), a financial services firm registered with the CFTC as a Futures Commission Merchant for participating in
unlawful wash trades and for failing to diligently supervise over a three and a half year period. The CFTC Order requires
SG Americas Securities, as successor to Newedge, to pay a $750,000 civil monetary penalty and comply with an
undertaking to improve its internal controls and procedures in order to detect and prevent the execution, clearing and
reporting to an exchange of non-bona fide exchange of futures for physical transactions (EFPs).

The CFTC Order finds that Newedge executed and confirmed the execution of, and reported to the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), numerous EFPs in agricultural and soft commodities, throughout the
period from June 2010 through at least January 2014, for and on behalf of its clients that are, are of the character of, or
are commonly known as wash sales. Such transactions are expressly prohibited in Section 4c(a) of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the CFTC Order, the EFP trades that Newedge executed and confirmed were for the same contract, quantity,
and same or similar price with the buyer and seller for each EFP under the same common control and ownership. The
Order further finds that the trades were executed under circumstances where certain Newedge account representatives
either knew that clients desired to net out futures positions across commonly owned and controlled accounts through the
use of EFPs, or else failed to inquire why clients were routinely on both sides of the EFPs. Accordingly, the transactions
constituted illegal âwash salesâ within the meaning of Section 4c(a) of the CEA. Moreover, the Order states that because
the EFPs were not done in accordance with the written rules of the CME and CBOT, they were not bona fide EFPs, and,
therefore, Newedge caused prices to be reported, registered, or recorded that were not true and bona fide prices, also in
violation of Section 4c(a) of the CEA. Further, by accepting and transmitting EFP orders that were not executed openly
and competitively pursuant to exchange rules, but in a manner that avoided market risk and price competition that
legitimate, competitive trading entails, Newedge executed noncompetitive trades for customers in violation of CFTC
Regulation 1.38(a), the Order finds.

The Order also finds that during the relevant period, Newedge failed to supervise diligently its employeesâ handling of the
transactions at issue and lacked adequate policies and procedures designed to detect and deter the execution of wash
EFP trades, in violation of CFTC Regulation 166.3.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Carlin Metzger, Joseph Patrick, Robert
Howell, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger, with assistance from Division of Market Oversight staff David Amato,
Eugene Kunda, and Jerry Lavin.

Federal Court Orders California Residents Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong and Their
Companies to Pay over $1.1 Million for Fraud and Registration Violations

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Cormac J.
Carney of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an Order of Default Judgment against
Defendants Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong, both residents of Irvine, California, and their companies, Bertram
Trade LLC and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC. The Order requires the Defendants jointly to pay restitution of
$448,371 and a $700,000 civil monetary penalty. The Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans
against them.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 28, 2015 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7114-15),
charging the Defendants with precious metals and futures fraud, misappropriation, engaging in illegal off-exchange
precious metals transactions, and registration violations in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations.

The Order finds that Defendants Valois and Wong fraudulently solicited, managed, or obtained $737,000 from six
customers through Bertram Trade and Churchhill. The Order further finds that Defendants falsely advertised on the
companiesâ websites that they would to buy, store, and insure leveraged precious metals for customers and claimed that
customers could access the precious metals at any time. However, according to the Order, the Defendants did not
provide any precious metals to customers, and instead misappropriated over $340,000 of customersâ funds by using
customer funds for personal and business expenses. Further, the Order finds that Valois, who had been banned from
membership by the National Futures Association in 2010, and his wife, Wong, acted as unregistered commodity trading
advisors by managing over $380,000 of customer funds in managed futures accounts when they were never registered
with the CFTC to do so.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged transactions such as those
conducted by Defendants are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of metal within 28
days. According to the Order, the Defendants never actually delivered any precious metals to any of their customers.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the National Futures Association in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Camille Arnold, Joseph Patrick, Robert Howell,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Orders UBS to Pay $15 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation and Spoofing In
the Precious Metals Futures Markets

UBSâs Penalty Was Substantially Reduced in Recognition of Its Self-Reporting, Cooperation
and Remediation

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against UBS AG (UBS), requiring UBS to pay a $15 million civil monetary penalty and to undertake remedial
relief. The Order finds that from January 2008 through at least December 2013, UBS, by and through the acts of certain
precious metals traders on the spot desk (Traders), attempted to manipulate the price of precious metals futures
contracts by utilizing a variety of manual spoofing techniques with respect to precious metals futures contracts traded on
the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX), including gold and silver, and by trading in a manner to trigger customer stop-
loss orders.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âTodayâs enforcement action demonstrates the
Commissionâs continued commitment to root out manipulation and spoofing in our markets. At the same time, this action
shows that the CFTC will recognize and reward market participants who self-report misconduct, cooperate in the
investigation, and remediate to fix the problems. Over the past year, the Division has worked to enhance its self-
reporting and cooperation program, including through the announcement of new cooperation advisories. The resolution
in this case, and the substantially reduced penalty for UBS, should send a strong signal to the market that the
Commission takes seriously the benefits of self-reporting and cooperation. In addition, todayâs actions reinforce the point
of our whole cooperation programâwhich is to identify and hold individuals accountable for misconduct, and not just the
companies that employ them.â

Further, as a reflection of the Divisionâs enhanced self-reporting and cooperation program, todayâs action shows that the
Commission will recognize and give meaningful credit to companies that substantially cooperate in our investigations and
proactively undertake remedial efforts.â

According to the Order, the Traders placed relatively large bids or offers with the intent to cancel before execution (spoof
orders) after another smaller bid or offer (resting orders) had been placed on the opposite side of the market. According
to the Order, the Traders placed their spoof orders with the intent to create the false appearance of market depth, which
the Traders believed and intended to create the impression of greater buying or selling interest than would have existed
otherwise. The Order finds that, in engaging in the misconduct, UBS, by and through the acts of the Traders, also
intended to manipulate the price of the relevant futures contract.

In addition, the Order finds that on certain other occasions between December 2009 through February 2012, UBS, by and
through the acts of one of the Traders, placed orders and executed trades to attempt to manipulate the price of precious
metals futures contracts in order to trigger customer stop-loss orders and obtain a profit on proprietary trading.

The Order finds that this conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act and Commission Regulations and imposes a civil
monetary penalty of $15 million, orders UBS to cease and desist from further violations, and to take specified steps to
maintain and implement training programs and systems and controls to detect and deter spoofing by UBS personnel.
The Order recognizes that UBS self-reported the misconduct, cooperated with the investigation and proactively took
remedial steps. As a result, the civil monetary penalty imposed by the Commission has been substantially reduced.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. and the UK Financial Conduct Authority.

This case is brought in connection with the CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members
responsible for this case are Lara Turcik, David Oakland, Neel Chopra, Katie Rasor, Sam Wasserman, Brandon Wozniak,
Alben Weinstein, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Charges Unregistered Forex Trading Firm and Its Principal with Fraud and
Misappropriation

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has filed a civil enforcement action in the Southern
District of New York against defendants Dominick Vincent Carducci and his company VOS Capital Management,
LLC (VOS Capital), both of South Carolina. The defendants are charged with fraud and misappropriation in connection
with the unlawful operation of a commodity pool that purported to trade leveraged or margined foreign currency (retail
forex). The CFTC complaint alleges fraudulent solicitation of at least 30 commodity pool participants, as well as the
misappropriation of over $1.1 million of pool funds that defendants used to reimburse certain participants and for
Carducciâs personal use, such as international travel, luxury automobiles, and student loan debt.

Starting in at least August 2016, according to the complaint, the defendants fraudulently solicited and misappropriated
money from at least 30 individuals for pooled investments in retail forex. Between August 2016 and September 2018,
the defendants received at least $1.1 million from pool participants for investment in commodity pools that would
purportedly trade forex. The defendants, however, never traded forex on behalf of pool participants, and concealed their
fraud by issuing false account statements to the pool participants.

As alleged in the complaint, in order to entice pool participants, the defendants falsely represented, among other things,
that:

e They had made large profits for themselves and pool participants from trading forex;

e They maintained a forex trading account with a registered foreign exchange dealer that had $12 million under
defendantsâ management;

e They would trade forex on behalf of pool participants;
e Pool participants would realize profits of up to 18% per month on their investments without losses;

e Pool participants could withdraw the funds they had invested upon request.

Rather than trade forex for pool participants, the defendants misappropriated the majority of pool funds.

As further alleged, upon the defendantsâ direction, pool participants deposited their funds into VOS Capitalâs bank
account. Thereafter, defendants used the majority of those funds to pay Carducciâs personal expenses, and to support
his lavish lifestyle by, among other things, acquiring luxury automobiles and paying for international travel. The
remainder of the funds was paid to some pool participants, in the style of a Ponzi scheme. The defendants also allegedly
created and issued false account statements to conceal their trading losses and misappropriation by inflating and
misrepresenting the value of pool participantsâ investments.

In its continuing litigation against the defendants, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary
penalties, restitution, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of
the Commodity Exchange Act, and CFTC regulations, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Alben Weinstein, Linda Y. Peng, David W.

CFTC Fines New York and UK-Based Firms for Net Capital Deficiencies

September 24, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued orders filing and settling charges
against Marex North America LLC, a registered futures commission merchant with its principal place of business in
New York, New York, and Marex Spectron International Limited, a registered introducing broker with its principal
place of business in London, United Kingdom, for failure to meet minimum adjusted net capital requirements.

The orders require Marex and Marex Spectron to pay civil monetary penalties of $250,000 and $120,000, respectively,
and require both entities to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
regulations, as charged.

âThe Division of Enforcement will remain vigilant in enforcing minimum capital requirements for registered entities as
they serve as important safeguards for the industry and its customers,â said Division of Enforcement Director James
McDonald.

Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight Director Joshua B. Sterling added, âWe will continue to work closely
and cooperatively with the Division of Enforcement to address deficiencies in required minimum adjusted net capital.â

Case Background

The orders find that, in computing their adjusted net capital, Marex and Marex Spectron each improperly accounted for
deductions arising out of an agreement they entered to guarantee a revolving line of credit for an affiliated company.
During the period in which Marex and Marex Spectron were guarantors, funds were periodically drawn on the line of
credit for the benefit of the affiliated company, in amounts ranging from $10 million to $95 million. However, neither
Marex nor Marex Spectron deducted the amount of the guaranteed drawdowns in their calculation of adjusted net capital
as required.

If the affiliateâs drawdowns had been correctly taken as deductions Marex, as a guarantor, would have been
undercapitalized for 33 months with net capital deficits ranging from approximately $4 million to $75 million in the
months when there were drawdowns. Likewise, Marex Spectron would have been undercapitalized in six of the 10 six-
month periods Marex Spectron was bound as a guarantor, with resulting deficits ranging from approximately $14 million
to $51 million. Introducing brokers report adjusted net capital every six months.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for these cases are Jon J. Kramer, David A. Terrell, Scott R.
Williamson, and Robert T. Howell.

Lisa M. Marlow and Tamara M. Dervin from the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight also contributed to

Enforcement Director Aitan Goelman to Leave CFTC

Washington, DC â U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Timothy Massad today announced
that Division of Enforcement Director Aitan Goelman will leave the agency on February 3, 2017. During Mr. Goelmanâs
tenure, the Division brought a number of first-in-kind cases utilizing the new enforcement authorities created by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Division also imposed and collected a record amount of
monetary sanctions as it fulfilled its mission of protecting investors from being victimized by fraud and manipulation, and
safeguarding the integrity of the financial markets overseen by the Commission.

Chairman Massad said: âDuring my confirmation hearing, | pledged that one of my priorities would be robust
enforcement, because it is critical to maintaining the integrity of our markets. Aitan Goelman has delivered. Under his
leadership, we have won path-breaking cases in spoofing and manipulation, protected investors from fraudulent actors,
held firms accountable for misdeeds, and secured judgments of hundreds of millions of dollars in restitution for victims.
We have also imposed penalties of more than seven times our aggregate budgets during the same period. In short, Aitan
and his team have done a terrific job. | thank him for his service to our country, and | wish him the best of luck in his
future endeavors.â

Commissioner J. Christopher Giancarlo added: ""Under Mr. Goelman's leadership the CFTC's Division of Enforcement has
taken its place as one of the premier law enforcement arms of the federal government. The Division's role is essential in
ensuring Americans that our markets are safe, secure and free of manipulation.""

Commissioner Sharon Bowen added: âI want to thank Aitan for his tireless efforts in furthering the CFTCâs mission to
protect market users and their funds, consumers, and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices. Under
his skilled leadership, the entire Division of Enforcement has worked diligently to file substantive and substantial cases
that not only brought wrong doing to light, but put the world on notice that there is a cop on the beat protecting the
derivatives markets we regulate. | have enjoyed working with him and his team and wish him the very best.â

Mr. Goelman said: âIt has been a true privilege to lead this remarkable Division, which battles every day through
adversity to get the job done for the American People. The men and women in the Division are as talented, committed
and resourceful as any group of professionals in the government, and together weâve been able to accomplish some
remarkable things. Iâd like to thank the employees of the Division, and of the Commission in general, for their devotion
and assistance. I'd also like to thank Chairman Massad for giving me the opportunity to do this job, for his trust and
confidence, and for his commitment to the pursuit of justice. | am also deeply grateful to Commissioners Giancarlo and
Bowen for their steadfast support of the enforcement program.â

During Mr. Goelmanâs tenure, the Division filed hundreds of successful enforcement actions covering the full gamut of the
Commissionâs authority. For example, it brought groundbreaking cases under several of the new Dodd-Frank authorities,
including the anti-spoofing provision, the new anti-manipulation authority in Rule 180.1, and the Commissionâs new
authority over the swaps markets. The Division brought the first-ever cases involving crypto-currency, through which the
Commission found that crypto-currency did, under certain circumstances, qualify as a âcommodityâ under the
Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

Under Mr. Goelman, the Division imposed more than $7 billion in monetary sanctions against a wide array of defendants.
These actions include record fines and collections for a single case, as well as record totals for a single day and for a
fiscal year.

The Division also increased its cooperation with other federal, state, and foreign civil regulators and criminal authorities.
This led to an increase in criminal prosecutions for CEA violations and high profile criminal matters like the successful
prosecution of Nav Sarao for spoofing and manipulation. The Divisionâs close working relationship with foreign authorities
allowed it to pursue a host of matters with misconduct that crossed over international borders, and to better coordinate
international resolutions, like its November 12, 2014 settlements for over $1.4 billion with five international banks for
manipulating foreign exchange benchmarks relied on by companies and individuals around the world. On the same day,
settlements with the same defendants were announced by authorities in the U.K. and Switzerland, as well as by U.S.
prudential regulators.

Finally, under Mr. Goelmanâs leadership, the CFTCâs Whistleblower Program has achieved a heightened profile and
effectiveness. In 2016, the Commission awarded its first ever whistleblower award of more than $10 million, and the
program continues to see an increase in the number and quality of tips that it receives.

Before joining the CFTC, Mr. Goelman was a litigation partner in the law firm of Zuckerman Spaeder. Prior to that, he
served for nine years in the Department of Justice, first as a Honor Graduate in the Criminal Division, then as a trial
attorney on the Oklahoma City Bombing Task Force, and finally as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of
New York. Mr. Goelman graduated from Yale Law School in 1993, after which he clerked for Justice Aharon Barak of the
Supreme Court of Israel.

CFTC Charges Canadian Resident Ryan S. Magee with Fraud and Acting as an Unregistered
Commodity Pool Operator

Magee Allegedly Fraudulently Solicited at Least $2 Million from at Least
30 Pool Participants in the U.S. and Canada, Misappropriated
Participant Funds, and Sent Participants False Statements Reporting
Non-Existent Profits

Mageeâs Father, David W. Magee, and his Wife, Dalyne Rae Magee, Are
Charged with Acting as Unregistered Associated Persons of Ryan Magee

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin charging Ryan S. Magee of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with fraud and
also with acting as a Commodity Pool Operator, without being registered with the CFTC, as required. The CFTC Complaint
also charges Ryan Mageeâs father and wife, David W. Magee and Dalyne Rae Magee, also both Calgary residents,
with acting as Associated Persons of Ryan Magee, without being registered with the CFTC, as required.

Specifically, the CFTCâs Complaint alleges that, between at least March 2010 and through at least August 2013, Ryan
Magee fraudulently solicited and accepted at least $2 million from at least 30 individuals from the U.S. and Canada,
claiming that he would trade commodity futures and other products on their behalf. Ryan allegedly 1) misappropriated at
least CAD 893,837 of the funds (approximately $653,000 at current exchange rates) and 2) lost at least CAD 1,360,348
trading in a brokerage account denominated in Canadian dollars and at least $13,015 in two accounts denominated in
U.S. dollars. As alleged, to hide the losses and misappropriation, Ryan Magee also sent pool participants false account
statements that reported non-existent profits. David and Dalyne Magee solicited funds for the Pool and handled
participant monies, according to the Complaint.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading
and registration bans, and injunctions against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The CFTCâs Enforcement Division thanks the staff of the Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) for their significant
assistance in this matter. Last year, in an enforcement action brought by the ASC, the Magees were each found liable for
violating the Alberta Securities Act, and Ryan Magee was found liable for perpetrating a fraud and making misleading or
untrue statements contrary to the Alberta Securities Act. The ASC is the Canadian regulatory agency responsible for
administering the province of Albertaâs securities laws.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Michael D. Frisch, Jon J. Kramer, Melissa
Cavers, David Terrell, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Charges North Carolina Resident Barry C. Taylor and His Companies with Commodity
Pool Fraud in a Multi-Million Dollar Fraudulent Forex Scheme and with Registration
Violations

Federal Court Enters Emergency Order Freezing Defendantsâ Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Defendantsâ Fraudulent Scheme Allegedly Solicited over $2.4 Million
from Approximately 24 Members of the Public

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil enforcement Complaint against
Barry C. Taylor of Franklin, North Carolina, charging him with operating a multi-million dollar fraudulent scheme
through his firms, OTC Investments LLC and Forex Currency Trade Advisors, LLC (collectively, Defendants). On
April 22, 2015, Judge Martin Reidinger of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Asheville
Division entered an emergency restraining Order freezing Defendantsâ assets and prohibiting the destruction or
concealment of their books and records. None of the Defendants has ever been registered with the CFTC, as is required.

The CFTC Complaint, filed under seal on April 21, 2015, alleges that from at least August 1, 2011 through the present,
the Defendants engaged in a fraudulent scheme that solicited more than $2.4 million from approximately 24 members of
the public in North Carolina and other states within the United States and in Canada to participate in a commodity pool
that traded leveraged or margined retail off-exchange foreign currency (forex) contracts.

The Complaint further alleges that Taylor misappropriated pool participant funds for personal and other business uses,
and to conceal his fraudulent scheme and misappropriation. Also, as alleged, Taylor issued or caused to be issued false
account statements to one or more pool participants to cover up his fraudulent scheme.

Taylor, among other things, allegedly made material misrepresentations and omissions to commodity pool participants
that 1) Defendants were engaged in profitable forex trading and 2) failed to disclose that Defendants traded only a
portion of pool participant funds and misappropriated the remainder through a combination of personal expenditures and
partial distributions of diminishing commodity pool funds to pool participants to lull and deceive them.

The Complaint also charges that the Defendants used pool participant funds to pay purported trading profits and
supposedly returned pool participantsâ principal in the manner of a Ponzi scheme.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks a return of ill-gotten gains, restitution, civil monetary penalties, trading and
registration bans, and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina and the

April 20, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today that it has issued an order filing
and settling charges against Jozef Gherman of Florida and J] Squared LLC, a Florida limited liability company, for
making misleading statements or omitting material facts in connection with soliciting more than $300,000 from over 40
individuals to invest in digital assets. Gherman was an employee and one of the founders of J Squared and was its
principal owner and CEO.

The order requires Gherman and J Squared to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty, with the amount to be paid by each
capped at $75,000, and any post-judgment interest. The order also requires Gherman and J Squared to pay $247,110 in
restitution, with the amount to be paid by each capped at $123,555, and any post-judgment interest. In addition, the
order imposes a 10-year ban on Gherman and J Squared from trading on or subject to the rules of any CFTC-registered
entity, and from engaging in any activities requiring registration with the CFTC.

âThe CFTC will continue to work to protect participants from false and misleading solicitation practices and hold those
engaging in such practices, including individuals, accountable,â said Acting Director of Enforcement Vincent McGonagle.

Federal Court in Illinois Orders Yumin Li and BVI-Based Company Kering Capital Ltd to
Pay More than $1.2 Million in a Penalty and Restitution for Prearranged Trading Fraud

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that on December 9,
2016, the Honorable Sara L. Ellis of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an Opinion and Order
(Order) finding that Defendant Yumin Li stole in excess of $300,000 from Liâs former employer by trading the employerâs
account noncompetitively against an account belonging to co-Defendant Kering Capital Ltd. (Kering), a British Virgin
Islands (BVI) company formed by Liâs mother.

The Courtâs Order requires Defendants to make restitution of over $300,000 to Liâs former employer and imposes a civil
monetary penalty of over $900,000, representing three times the Defendantsâ unlawful gains. The Court also enjoins Li
from trading in the commodity futures markets for five years and prohibits Kering from allowing Li access to its trading
accounts and from relying upon Li for trading advice and direction for the same period. The Court also permanently
enjoins Li and Kering from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on July 1, 2015, that charged Li and Kering with fraud, fictitious
sales, and non-competitive transactions in connection with a series of transactions engineered by Li on the CME Group
Inc.âs electronic trading platform that resulted in âmoney passes,â whereby Li moved money from her former employerâs
trading account to Keringâs trading account (see CFTC Complaint and Release No. 7193-15, July 6, 2015).

In the Order, the Court finds that undisputed facts established that on six separate occasions between March 17 and

May 6, 2015, Li intentionally engineered and engaged in commodity futures trades that were designed to give the
appearance of taking place on the open market, while in reality were structured to avoid market risk, and resulted in a
gain to Kering at the expense of Liâs former employer. The Court finds that Li prearranged trades by trading her
employerâs account opposite an account she controlled at Kering, while concentrating the trading in illiquid Eurodollar
contracts outside of normal trading hours. Using this strategy, Li stole $300,462.50 from her employer and moved it to
Kering. In the Order, the Court also finds that Li was not authorized by her employer to enter into any of the transactions,
and that Kering is vicariously liable for Liâs trading. According to the Order, Li fled the United States after her employer
discovered the trading activity and confronted Li about the trades.

In holding Li liable, the Court rejected Liâs argument that her employerâs alleged mistreatment of her provided any
mitigating basis for her conduct, and found that Liâs belief that executing the illegal trades was the only way in which she
would receive the compensation that she believed her employer owed her did not absolve her of the theft. The Court
found that âLiâs actions have undermined public confidence in the commodities markets,â and that the market harm she
inflicted is âeven more insidious and damaging than the stolen funds themselves.â

The CFTC thanks the CME Group Inc. for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC staff members responsible for this action are Lindsey Evans, Melissa Cavers, David Terrell, Scott Williamson, and
Rosemary Hollinger.

",Release Number 7498-16,"December 14, 2016",Federal Court in Illinois Orders Yumin Li and BVI-Based Company Kering Capital Ltd to. Pay More than $1.2 Million in a Penalty and Restitution for Prearranged Trading Fraud.,"Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that on December 9, 2016, the Honorable Sara L. Ellis of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an Opinion and Order (Order) finding that Defendant Yumin Li stole in excess of $300,000 from Li’s former employer by trading the employer’s account noncompetitively against an account belonging to co-Defendant Kering Capital Ltd. (Kering), a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company formed by Li’s mother.

The Court’s Order requires Defendants to make restitution of over $300,000 to Li’s former employer and imposes a civil monetary penalty of over $900,000, representing three times the Defendants’ unlawful gains. The Court also enjoins Li from trading in the commodity futures markets for five years and prohibits Kering from allowing Li access to its trading accounts and from relying upon Li for trading advice and direction for the same period. The Court also permanently enjoins Li and Kering from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The Court’s Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on July 1, 2015, that charged Li and Kering with fraud, fictitious sales, and non-competitive transactions in connection with a series of transactions engineered by Li on the CME Group Inc.’s electronic trading platform that resulted in “money passes,” whereby Li moved money from her former employer’s trading account to Kering’s trading account (see CFTC Complaint and Release No. 7193-15, July 6, 2015).

In the Order, the Court finds that undisputed facts established that on six separate occasions between March 17 and
May 6, 2015, Li intentionally engineered and engaged in commodity futures trades that were designed to give the appearance of taking place on the open market, while in reality were structured to avoid market risk, and resulted in a gain to Kering at the expense of Li’s former employer. The Court finds that Li prearranged trades by trading her employer’s account opposite an account she controlled at Kering, while concentrating the trading in illiquid Eurodollar contracts outside of normal trading hours. Using this strategy, Li stole $300,462.50 from her employer and moved it to Kering. In the Order, the Court also finds that Li was not authorized by her employer to enter into any of the transactions, and that Kering is vicariously liable for Li’s trading. According to the Order, Li fled the United States after her employer discovered the trading activity and confronted Li about the trades.

In holding Li liable, the Court rejected Li’s argument that her employer’s alleged mistreatment of her provided any mitigating basis for her conduct, and found that Li’s belief that executing the illegal trades was the only way in which she would receive the compensation that she believed her employer owed her did not absolve her of the theft. The Court found that “Li’s actions have undermined public confidence in the commodities markets,” and that the market harm she inflicted is “even more insidious and damaging than the stolen funds themselves.”
The CFTC thanks the CME Group Inc. for its assistance in this matter.","CFTC staff members responsible for this action are Lindsey Evans, Melissa Cavers, David Terrell, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Charges Pennsylvania Resident William H. Powderly IV with Fraudulently Soliciting Commodity
Futures Customers and Distributing False Account Statements

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Illinois, charging Defendant, William H. Powderly IV (Powderly) of New Hope,
Pennsylvania, with fraudulently soliciting at least $825,000 from at least four customers for purposes of trading
commodity futures on their behalf in an account in Powderlyâs name. The Complaint also charges Powderly with making
and providing false and misleading account statements to his customers.

In particular, the Complaint alleges that from at least January 2016 through October 2016, Powderly solicited customers
and prospective customers by claiming that he and a university professor had developed a commodity futures trading
program that generated exceptional hypothetical trading results and that âbetaâ testing of this system generated
consistent gains without a single day of loss. The Complaint further alleges that when soliciting customers and
prospective customers, Powderly failed to tell them that the actual commodity trading he conducted for his commodity
account during that 10-month period was consistently unprofitable, sustaining losses every month during that time.
Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Powderly created false account statements for his trading account and sent them
to his customers in order to conceal his trading losses.

In its continuing litigation against the Defendant, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of
ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against
violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Diane M. Romaniuk, Joseph Patrick, Lindsey
Evans, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.

online.

The complaint further alleges that at least 27 individual customers deposited at least $989,000 with one or more

CFTC Charges Estonian Company Tallinex with Fraud and Failure to Register as a Retail
Foreign Exchange Dealer and Nevada Company General Trader Fulfillment with Failure to
Register as an Introducing Broker

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah against Tallinex a/k/a Tallinex Limited (Tallinex), of
Tallinn, Estonia, and General Trader Fulfillment (GTF), a Nevada company doing business in Pleasant Grove, Utah. The
CFTCâs Complaint charges Tallinex with operating as a Retail Foreign Exchange Dealer (RFED), without being registered
as such with the CFTC, and with fraudulently soliciting U.S. resident customers to trade leveraged foreign currencies
(forex). The Complaint charges GTF with acting as an unregistered Introducing Broker (IB) by soliciting U.S. customers to
open forex trading accounts with Tallinex.

Specifically, from at least September 2012 and continuing to at least September 2016, Tallinex fraudulently solicited and
accepted at least $1.5 million from U.S. customers in connection with leveraged or margined forex transactions, to which
it was or offered to be the counterparty. Moreover, according to the Complaint, in the course of soliciting retail forex
customers, Tallinex made fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions of material fact and engaged in fraudulent and
deceptive business practices. For example, Tallinex allegedly defrauded its U.S. customers by 1) falsely representing that
Tallinex was lawfully doing business in the United States, 2) misrepresenting and omitting the likelihood of profits and
risk of loss involved in trading their forex contracts, and 3) misrepresenting the safety of customer funds in the event of
Tallinexâs financial collapse (/.e., counterparty risk).

According to the Complaint, Tallinex also operates an introducing broker program whereby GTF, and companies similar to
GTF, introduce trading accounts to Tallinex and receive commissions on revenue generated by the accountsâ trading
activity.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil
monetary penalty, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of

CFTC Charges Forex Trader and Firm with Fraud and Registration Violations

Washington, DCâThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a federal court enforcement action in
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Jason Amada of New York, New York, and Amada
Capital Management LLC (ACM), a New York entity owned and controlled by Amada. The CFTC Complaint charges
that, from at least February 2014 through at least November 2015, the Defendants fraudulently solicited potential clients
to open individually managed trading accounts for off-exchange foreign currency contracts (forex) and hid substantial
trading losses incurred as a result of Defendantsâ managed forex trading.

Specifically, the Complaint alleges that the Defendants fraudulently solicited clients for these accounts by, among other
things, misrepresenting Defendantsâ forex trading experience and profitability. In addition, the Complaint alleges that
the Defendants made the false claim that they would implement a hedging strategy that would prevent losses of more
than one percent. As further alleged, Defendants attempted to conceal mounting losses by transferring some of their
commissions into a clientâs account. The Complaint also alleges that the Defendants failed to register with the CFTC as
required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans,
disgorgement, and a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC
Regulations, as charged.

Related Criminal Charges

Today, the New York State Office of the Attorney General announced a criminal indictment charging Amada with Grand
Larceny in the Second Degree and a violation of the Martin Act, a New York State statute that prohibits, among other
things, the fraudulent sale of commodities products.

CFTC Orders Paris-Based SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale SA to Pay a $450,000 Penalty for Failing to
Timely Report Swap Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale SA (SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale) for failing to properly report certain
non-deliverable forward transactions to a swap data repository (SDR), and failing to timely report to an SDR a large
number of FX swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA) and CFTC Regulations. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale is a swap dealer headquartered in Paris, France that has been
provisionally registered with the CFTC in that capacity since December 31, 2012.

The CFTC Order requires SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale to pay a $450,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from
committing further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

As stated in the Order, the accuracy and completeness of swap reporting are critical to the Commission's mission to
protect market participants and to ensure market integrity. In particular, the Order states that the CEA requires parties to
a swap transaction to report swap transaction information to a registered SDR in a timely manner, and requires swap
dealers to report swap transactions to an SDR within such time period as prescribed by the CFTC. The Order further
states that CFTC Regulations 43 and 45 specify requirements for real-time public reporting, public availability of swap
transaction and pricing data, and reporting of creation and continuation data to an SDR. According to the Order, the
reporting requirements are designed to enhance transparency, promote standardization, and reduce systemic risk.

The Order finds that in July 2014 SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale implemented a software update to its FX trading platform which led to
the trading platform incorrectly coding SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs counterparty as the reporting counterparty for certain FX
swap, FX forward, and non-deliverable forward transactions, which resulted in no reports being made to the SDR
regarding the swaps. According to the Order, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale did not discover the error until January 2015, and it was
not until April 2015 that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale was able to fix it. The Order finds that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale initiated a project to
identify trades affected by the coding error and in September 2015 notified CFTC staff about its failure to report.
According to the Order, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale back-loaded approximately 51,821 unreported transactions in October 2015
and in April and May 2016 made submissions to its SDR for approximately 2,024 non-deliverable forward transactions.

The Order recognizes that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale cooperated with the CFTCâs investigation by self-reporting its errors,
undertaking an internal investigation, and taking remedial action to correct its reporting failures.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Diane M. Romaniuk, Ava Gould, Mary Elizabeth
Spear, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger. The Division of Market Oversight staff members responsible for this
matter are Daniel J. Bucsa and Thomas Guerin.

CFTC Orders Glencore Agriculture B.V. and Glencore Ltd. to Pay a $2 Million Penalty for
Exceeding Cotton Futures Position Limits, Transacting Illegal EFPs, and Submitting
Inaccurate Form 304s

Cotton Trading by Glencore Agriculture B.V. and Glencore Ltd. Was under Common Control
by Head of Glencore Cotton Trading

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Glencore Agriculture B.V., f/k/a Glencore Grain B.V. (Glencore B.V.), located in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, and Glencore Ltd., located in Stamford, Connecticut, finding that on multiple trading days during May
2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. held net positions in the ICE Futures Cotton
No. 2 contracts (cotton futures) that, on an aggregated basis, exceeded the speculative position limits established by the
CFTC. In addition, the CFTC Order finds that on twenty-four occasions between January 2013 and November 2015,
Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed exchange of futures for physical transactions (EFPs) opposite each otherâs
cotton futures trading accounts, even though their accounts were not independently controlled as required for such
transactions not to constitute illegal wash trades. And, on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, Glencore B.V.
submitted to the CFTC a Form 304 that failed to represent accurately all required information, including its short cash
sales commitments, according to the CFTC Order.

The CFTC Order requires Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd., jointly and severally, to pay a $2 million civil monetary penalty
and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

According to the CFTC Order, at all times relevant to the Order, Glencore centralized the management of its global cotton
business under the direction of a single trading manager (referred to in the Order as Head of Cotton), who oversaw
cotton operations across all Glencore entities. The Head of Cotton directly supervised cotton traders at Glencore B.V. and
was also the direct supervisor of Glencore Ltd.âs head cotton trader.

The CEA and CFTC Regulations set limits on the net long or net short position that any person may hold or control for
certain commodities, including a limit of 5,000 cotton futures for a single month, other than the spot month, exclusive of
bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC Order finds that because Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. operated their
cotton trading under the common control of Glencoreâs Head of Cotton, their cotton futures positions should have been
aggregated for purposes of complying with the Commissionâs position limits. When aggregated, the cotton futures
positions of Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. exceeded 5,000 net contracts, exclusive of bona fide hedging transactions,
on multiple days during May 2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014.

The CEA and CFTC Regulations permit noncompetitive trading, such as EFPs, only if such transactions are conducted in
accordance with rules of an exchange, such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), that are approved by the CFTC. At all
times relevant to this Order, ICE rules permitted the transaction of EFPs between independently controlled accounts.
However, the CFTC Order finds that Glencore B.V.âs and Glencore Ltd.âs cotton futures trading accounts were both
ultimately controlled by Glencoreâs Head of Cotton. As a result they were not independently controlled. Nevertheless,
between January 2013 and November 2015, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed twenty-four EFPs opposite one
anotherâs accounts, according to the CFTC Order.

The Order further states that CFTC Regulations require cotton merchants and dealers holding or controlling reportable
futures positions to file a monthly Statement of Cash Positions in Cotton (Form 304), as of the close of business on the
last Friday of the month. On the Form 304, entities report the composition of their fixed price cash position in cotton and
cotton products, including the quantity of open fixed price purchase and fixed price sale commitments. The CFTC Order
finds that Glencore B.V. filed two erroneous Form 304 reports with the CFTCâone on May 31, 2013 and a second on May
30, 2014âthat overstated the quantities of its fixed price cotton cash positions.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are James Deacon, Ilana Waxman, Laura
Brookover, Kara Mucha, John Buffington, James H. Holl, Ill, and Rick Glaser. The Division of Enforcement would like to
recognize the assistance of other CFTC staff: Janet Briner, Kelly Beck, Harry Hild, and Matthew Hunter.

Exceeding Cotton Futures Position Limits, Transacting Illegal EFPs, and Submitting. Inaccurate Form 304s. Cotton Trading by Glencore Agriculture B.V. and Glencore Ltd. Was under Common Control. by Head of Glencore Cotton Trading.","Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an order filing and settling charges against Glencore Agriculture B.V., f/k/a Glencore Grain B.V. (Glencore B.V.), located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Glencore Ltd., located in Stamford, Connecticut, finding that on multiple trading days during May 2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. held net positions in the ICE Futures Cotton No. 2 contracts (cotton futures) that, on an aggregated basis, exceeded the speculative position limits established by the CFTC. In addition, the CFTC Order finds that on twenty-four occasions between January 2013 and November 2015, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed exchange of futures for physical transactions (EFPs) opposite each other’s cotton futures trading accounts, even though their accounts were not independently controlled as required for such transactions not to constitute illegal wash trades. And, on at least two occasions in 2013 and 2014, Glencore B.V.
 submitted to the CFTC a Form 304 that failed to represent accurately all required information, including its short cash sales commitments, according to the CFTC Order.

The CFTC Order requires Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd., jointly and severally, to pay a $2 million civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

According to the CFTC Order, at all times relevant to the Order, Glencore centralized the management of its global cotton business under the direction of a single trading manager (referred to in the Order as Head of Cotton), who oversaw cotton operations across all Glencore entities. The Head of Cotton directly supervised cotton traders at Glencore B.V. and was also the direct supervisor of Glencore Ltd.’s head cotton trader.

The CEA and CFTC Regulations set limits on the net long or net short position that any person may hold or control for certain commodities, including a limit of 5,000 cotton futures for a single month, other than the spot month, exclusive of bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC Order finds that because Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. operated their cotton trading under the common control of Glencore’s Head of Cotton, their cotton futures positions should have been aggregated for purposes of complying with the Commission’s position limits. When aggregated, the cotton futures positions of Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. exceeded 5,000 net contracts, exclusive of bona fide hedging transactions, on multiple days during May 2013, June 2013, May 2014, and June 2014.

The CEA and CFTC Regulations permit noncompetitive trading, such as EFPs, only if such transactions are conducted in accordance with rules of an exchange, such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), that are approved by the CFTC. At all times relevant to this Order, ICE rules permitted the transaction of EFPs between independently controlled accounts.
 However, the CFTC Order finds that Glencore B.V.’s and Glencore Ltd.’s cotton futures trading accounts were both ultimately controlled by Glencore’s Head of Cotton. As a result they were not independently controlled. Nevertheless, between January 2013 and November 2015, Glencore B.V. and Glencore Ltd. executed twenty-four EFPs opposite one another’s accounts, according to the CFTC Order.

The Order further states that CFTC Regulations require cotton merchants and dealers holding or controlling reportable futures positions to file a monthly Statement of Cash Positions in Cotton (Form 304), as of the close of business on the last Friday of the month.

CFTC Finds Former Trader David Liew Engaged in Spoofing and Manipulation of the Gold
and Silver Futures Markets and Permanently Bans Him from Trading and Other Activities
in CFTC-Regulated Markets

CFIC Recognizes Liewâs Cooperation and Substantial Assistance in the
Investigation, which Included Entering into a Cooperation Agreement
with the Division of Enforcement

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against David Liew for engaging in numerous acts of spoofing, attempted manipulation, and, at times,
manipulation of the gold and silver futures markets. Liew engaged in this unlawful conduct for more than two years while
he was employed as a junior trader on the precious metals desk for a large financial institution (Financial Institution 1).
The CFTC Order finds that Liew acted individually and in coordination with traders at Financial Institution 1 and with a
trader at another large financial institution.

In the Order, Liew admits the facts of his manipulation and spoofing activity and acknowledges that his conduct violated
the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission Regulations.

The Order permanently bans Liew from trading commodity interests and requires him to comply with undertakings never
to engage in other commodity-interest related activities, including seeking registration, acting in a capacity requiring
registration, or acting as a principal, agent, officer or employee of any person registered, required to be registered or
exempt from registration.

In accepting Liewâs offer of settlement, the CFTC recognizes Liewâs cooperation during the Division of Enforcementâs
(Division) investigation of this matter, including his entry into a formal Cooperation Agreement with the Division, his
provision of substantial assistance to the investigation, and his undertaking to continue to cooperate with the
Commission, the Division and any other governmental agency in connection with the subject matter of this Order.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âTodayâs enforcement action demonstrates that the
Commission will aggressively pursue individuals who manipulate and spoof in our markets. Todayâs action also shows
that while holding individuals accountable for their conduct, the Commission will give meaningful cooperation credit to
those who acknowledge their own wrongdoing, enter into a Cooperation Agreement and provide substantial assistance to
the Division in its investigations and enforcement actions against others who have engaged in illegal conduct.â

The Order specifically finds that from at least December 2009 through February 2012, Liew, on numerous occasions,
acting individually and in coordination with other traders on the precious metals trading desk of Financial Institution 1,
placed orders to buy or sell gold or silver futures contracts that he did not intend to execute at the time the orders were
placed (spoof orders). Generally, Liewâs spoof orders were placed in the futures market after another bid or offer was
placed on the opposite side of the same market. Liew placed his spoof orders with the intent to create the false
appearance that the market interest in buying or selling was greater than the actual market interest. Liew placed such
spoof orders with the intent to induce other market participants to fill Liewâs resting orders on the opposite side of the
market from his spoof orders. In engaging in the spoofing conduct, Liew also intended to manipulate, and at times
succeeded in manipulating the price of the relevant futures contract.

Separately, on certain occasions, Liew placed orders and executed trades with the intent of manipulating the market
price of gold and silver futures contracts for the purpose of triggering customersâ stop-loss orders. Liew coordinated this
trading with another precious metals trader at another large financial institution. The intent of triggering the customer
stop-loss orders was to allow the traders to buy precious metals futures contracts at artificially low prices or sell precious
metals futures contracts at artificially high prices.

Criminal Action

In addition, on June 1, 2017, Liew pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and spoofing. (U.S. v.
Liew, Case No. 17-CR-1 (N.D. Ill.).

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Katie Rasor, Neel Chopra, Lara Turcik, Sam
Wasserman, Bryan Bughman, Brandon Wozniak, Alben Weinstein, Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M.

CFTC Division of Enforcement Issues Advisory on Violations of the Commodity Exchange
Act Involving Foreign Corrupt Practices

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Division of Enforcement today announced an
Enforcement Advisory on self-reporting and cooperation for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) involving foreign
corrupt practices. CFTCâs Enforcement Director James McDonald announced the new Advisory in remarks he made today at the
American Bar Associationâs National Institute on White Collar Crime.

âCombatting misconduct that affects our financial markets has truly become a team effort, and that is particularly true with
respect to foreign corrupt practices,â said McDonald. âWe at the CFTC will do our job as part of the team to identify this type of
misconduct in our markets and hold wrongdoers accountable, working closely with our enforcement partners domestically and
abroad. This new Enforcement Advisory provides further clarity surrounding the benefits of self-reporting misconduct, full
cooperation, and remediation in this context, and it reflects the enhanced coordination between the CFTC and our law
enforcement partners like the Department of Justice.â

Brian A. Benczkowski, Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Division, said âTogether with the
Departmentâs Corporate Enforcement Policy, CFTCâs Advisory on self-reporting and cooperation will make clear to companies the
significant benefits of voluntarily self-disclosing misconduct, fully cooperating with the governmentâs investigation, and
remediating the misconduct. We look forward to working in parallel with the CFTC in cases involving foreign corrupt practices, as
well as others.â

In prior Advisories, the Enforcement Division has made clear that it gives substantial credit for self-reporting and cooperation in
determining, among other things, the appropriate level of sanctions to impose or seek. With todayâs Advisory, the Enforcement
Division builds on that foundation to further incentivize individuals and companies to self-report misconduct, cooperate fully in
CFTC investigations and enforcement actions, and appropriately remediate to ensure the wrongdoing does not happen again.

* * *

Anyone with information about foreign corrupt practices in the commodities or derivatives markets can share that information
with the CFTC Whistleblower Office at whistleblower.gov. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 percent and 30
percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower awards are paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund
established by Congress and financed entirely through monetary sanctions paid to CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is
taken or withheld from those harmed to fund the program.

CFTC Orders New York Man to Pay More than $1 Million for Role in Fraudulent Binary
Options Scheme

April 06, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Glenn Olson formerly of Brooklyn, New York, for his role in a binary options fraud that harmed U.S. customers
involving Blue Bit Banc, a United Kingdom company, and Blue Bit Analytics, Ltd, located in Turks and Caicos.

The order requires Olson to disgorge all of his ill-gotten gains, totaling $241,070. He is also ordered to pay restitution of
$846,405, a joint obligation with others found liable and enjoined by a federal court in a prior CFTC enforcement action.
[See CFTC v. Kantor, No. 18-cv-2247-SJF-ARL (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2019) and CFTC Press Release No. 8069-19] Olson is also
ordered to cease and desist from further violating the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations, from trading on or
subject to the rules of any CFTC-registered entity, and from engaging in any activities requiring registration with the
CFTC.

Case Background

The order findsâand Olson admittedâthat from approximately April 2014 through March 2018, he was affiliated with
Blue Bit Banc and related entities, selling binary options to customers for Blue Bit using alias names and also supervising
other sales staff at Blue Bitâs Manhattan office. Olson also admitted that, as part of the scheme, he and others
misrepresented the profitability of trading through Blue Bit, manipulated or fabricated purported trades in their
customersâ accounts to the customersâ disadvantage, prevented customers from withdrawing funds, and misappropriated
customer funds.

The order states that Olson also admitted he knowingly made false statements, omitted statements of material fact, and
took other actions to defraud customers, while receiving disbursements totaling $241,070.30. In addition, Olson was
involved in the conversion of some customersâ Blue Bit account holdings into ATM Coin, a worthless cryptocurrency that
was represented as being worth substantial money. According to the order, at least 27 customers lost a total of $846,405
as a result of the fraudulent scheme.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost, because wrongdoers may
not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Susan Padove, Joseph Patrick, David Terrell,
Scott Williamson, and Robert Howell.

Federal Court Orders New Mexico Man to Pay Over $10.3 Million for Defrauding
Commodity Futures Clients in Long-Running Ponzi Scheme

April 08, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the
District of New Mexico entered a consent order for permanent injunction, monetary sanctions, and equitable relief
against Douglas Lien of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The court imposed more than $10.3 million in monetary sanctions and
relief for defendantâs wrongdoing, including his misappropriation of client money intended for futures trading. According
to the order, the defendant admitted to misappropriating the funds and issuing false account statements to conceal his
fraud for nearly 20 years.

The order requires that Lien pay restitution of $5,195,679 and a civil penalty of $5,195,679, and imposes permanent
trading and registration bans. The judgment resolves a CFTC enforcement case filed on December 9, 2019. [See CFTC
Press Release No. 8094-19]

Case Background

According to the order, Lien admits that from at least August 2000 until December 9, 2019, he solicited more than $14.2
million from 45 individuals to manage their trading in commodity futures, specifically U.S. Treasury Bond futures.
However, Lien did not invest the client funds, but instead operated a classic Ponzi scheme, using the money to pay other
clients. He also kept more than $3.5 million for so-called âmanagement feesâ he billed clients based on false trading
profits. In addition, Lien gave his clients inaccurate account statements, including erroneous annual IRS Form 1099s that
reported millions in fake profits. The order also states Lien failed to register as a futures commission merchant (FCM) to
legally solicit and accept money from commodity futures clients for futures trades.

The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure that wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation and assistance of the State of New Mexico Securities Division.

CFTC Charges Companies and Associates with Failing to Register with the CFTC

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Silver Star FX, LLC d/b/a Silver Star Live (SSL) of New Mexico and Silver Star Live Software LLC (SSLS)
of Florida, and two officers of those firms, Candace Ross-Mahmoud and Hassan Mahmoud of California (collectively,
respondents). In its order, the CFTC found that SSL and SSLS acted as unregistered commodity trading advisors and that
Ross-Mahmoud and Mahmoud acted as unregistered associated persons of both SSL and SSLS. The order requires the
respondents, who are jointly and severally liable, to pay a $75,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from
future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The order finds that from at least July 2018 to March 2019, on behalf of SSL and, later, SSLS, Ross-Mahmoud and
Mahmoud solicited customers to open discretionary trading accounts (or supervised other persons who did so), and
offered to trade in customersâ retail forex accounts through a âforex autotrader.â The autotrader used an algorithm to
trade multiple currency pairs, automatically entering and exiting trades without customer intervention. The autotrader
also purportedly automatically hedged losing trades to mitigate losses. By virtue of the autotrader, SSL and SSLS
exercised discretionary trading authority over retail customersâ forex accounts.

As found in the order, respondents marketed the autotrader using the slogan âOur Trades, Your Account,â and in
promotional video presentations, Mahmoud described the autotrader as â95% hands-offâ after initial set up. Although
customers were required to set up the autotrader and load periodic updates, those efforts were supported by SSL and
SSLS staff. Further, respondents touted the autotrader as suitable for people without any prior forex trading experience.
Ross-Mahmoud and Mahmoud and, at their direction, the affiliates of SSL and SSLS, instructed individual customers to

",Release Number 8071-19,"November 4, 2019",CFTC Charges Companies and Associates with Failing to Register with the CFTC.,"Washington, DC — The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges against Silver Star FX, LLC d/b/a Silver Star Live (SSL) of New Mexico and Silver Star Live Software LLC (SSLS) of Florida, and two officers of those firms, Candace Ross-Mahmoud and Hassan Mahmoud of California (collectively, respondents). In its order, the CFTC found that SSL and SSLS acted as unregistered commodity trading advisors and that Ross-Mahmoud and Mahmoud acted as unregistered associated persons of both SSL and SSLS. The order requires the respondents, who are jointly and severally liable, to pay a $75,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from future violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.

The order finds that from at least July 2018 to March 2019, on behalf of SSL and, later, SSLS, Ross-Mahmoud and Mahmoud solicited customers to open discretionary trading accounts (or supervised other persons who did so), and offered to trade in customers’ retail forex accounts through a “forex autotrader.” The autotrader used an algorithm to trade multiple currency pairs, automatically entering and exiting trades without customer intervention. The autotrader also purportedly automatically hedged losing trades to mitigate losses. By virtue of the autotrader, SSL and SSLS exercised discretionary trading authority over retail customers’ forex accounts.

As found in the order, respondents marketed the autotrader using the slogan “Our Trades, Your Account,” and in promotional video presentations, Mahmoud described the autotrader as “95% hands-off” after initial set up. Although customers were required to set up the autotrader and load periodic updates, those efforts were supported by SSL and SSLS staff. Further, respondents touted the autotrader as suitable for people without any prior forex trading experience.
 Ross-Mahmoud and Mahmoud and, at their direction, the affiliates of SSL and SSLS, instructed individual customers to open and fund accounts at retail forex exchange dealers and link the accounts to the autotrader.

Federal Court Orders Defendants to Pay Nearly $1.3 Million in Forex Fraud Scheme

July 10, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Missouri entered an order of default judgment finding that Joshua Christian McDonald and his
company, Perfection PR Firm LLC (PPR), committed fraud, misappropriated customer funds, and operated without
proper registration. The defendants operated out of California and Tennessee.

The courtâs June 9, 2020 order requires the defendants to pay $360,565 in restitution to defrauded customers and a civil
monetary penalty of $935,907. Additionally, the order permanently enjoins the defendants from engaging in conduct that
violates the Commodity Exchange Act, from registering with the CFTC, and from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets.

The order resolves a CFTC enforcement case filed on February 14, 2020, charging the defendants with fraud and
misappropriation related to an off-exchange foreign currency (forex) trading scheme in which they solicited funds totaling
at least $440,000 from at least 12 customers, including multiple residents of Missouri. [See CFTC Press Release No. 8119-
20] The CFTC charged that, in soliciting funds for and operating a pooled investment vehicle, PPR acted as an
unregistered commodity pool operator and McDonald acted as an unregistered Associated Person of PPR. The defendants
falsely represented to prospective customers that McDonald was profitably trading forex and promised customers that
their accounts would grow in value 10 to 50 percent per month, among other things. In fact, McDonald did not trade forex
as successfully as he claimed and actually lost money. Moreover, the defendants misappropriated customersâ funds by
transferring funds into cryptocurrency accounts in McDonaldâs name, paying McDonaldâs personal expenses, and failing
to return funds upon customersâ requests. Customers lost most or all of their funds as a result of the defendantsâ fraud
and misappropriation.

Related Criminal Action

In a related criminal case, on January 29, 2020, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri indicted
McDonald on four counts of wire fraud. [See United States v. Joshua C. McDonald, 4:20-CR-70 SRC SPM (E.D. Mo.)]

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Securities Division of the Missouri Secretary of Stateâs Office, and the Securities Division of
the Mississippi Secretary of Stateâs Office.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost, because wrongdoers may
not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure wrongdoers are held accountable.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Julia Colarusso, Hillary Van
Tassel, Christine Ryall, Paul Hayeck, and former staff member Greta Gao.

Federal Court in Illinois Orders Futures International LLC and its Chief Operating Officer,
Amedeo Cerrone, to Pay $500,000 Penalty for Recordkeeping Violations, False Statements,
Unauthorized Trading, and Supervision Failures

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Robert W.
Gettleman of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a Consent Order settling CFTC charges
against Defendants Chicago-based Futures International LLC (Fl) and its Chief Operating Officer Amedeo Cerrone of
St. Charles, Illinois, for failing to adequately record customer orders; failing to maintain required records relating to
commodity futures transactions; submitting order tickets bearing false timestamps; unauthorized trading; and failing to
provide adequate supervision. Fl is a registered Introducing Broker. The Order requires Fl and Cerrone jointly to pay a
civil monetary penalty of $500,000.

The Courtâs Order stems from a CFTC Amended Complaint filed October 9, 2014 (see CFTC Press Release and Amended
Complaint 7034-14, October 9, 2014).

The Order finds that, between January 2009 and November 2012, FI failed to record all customer orders immediately
upon receipt, as required by CFTC Regulations, and that Fl employees instead often recorded order information only after
orders were executed. In particular, the Order finds, with Cerroneâs knowledge, Fl employees routinely timestamped
blank order tickets and then used these âpre-timestampedâ tickets to document trades, making it appear as though FI
had complied with the applicable recordkeeping requirements. Ultimately, Flâs order tickets with false timestamp
information were transmitted to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for clearing, according to the Order.

The Order also finds that Fl employees communicated electronically about commodity futures transactions, including via
instant messages. Although Cerrone knew this and was responsible for collecting such communications, FI failed to
maintain full and complete records of these communications, in violation of CFTC Regulations, according to the Order.
The failure to retain all electronic communications relating to Flâs commodity futures transactions resulted in an
incomplete audit trail hindering the CFTCâs ability to investigate violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and
CFTC Regulations, the Order finds.

Additionally, according to the Order, Fl, through one of its principals, improperly exercised discretion over commercial
customersâ accounts without written powers of attorney and executed trades without first receiving instructions from
customers as to the commodity to be purchased and the amount. At times, Fl employees executed trades without
knowing whether any customer would even accept the trade.

The Order further finds that Fl did not have written policies and procedures regarding trading floor operations until at
least September 2012 and that Fl and Cerrone did not provide adequate training to employees. Additionally, they failed
to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the CEA and CFTC Regulations.

In addition to requiring Fl and Cerrone to pay a civil monetary penalty of $500,000, the Order also permanently prohibits
Fl and Cerrone from further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

On October 9, 2014, the CFTC filed and settled charges against Kent Woods, Flâs former Chief Executive Officer, for
violations arising from the same underlying facts (see CFTC Press Release and Order 7034-14, October 9, 2014). The
Order in that action requires Woods to pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty, to cooperate in any related action, and to
execute all non-electronic orders only through his current employerâs floor desk for two years. The Order also
permanently prohibits Woods from further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the CME Group, Inc. in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Allison Passman, Daniel Burstein, Joseph
Patrick, Theodore Polley, Susan Gradman, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger. Samantha Coxe also assisted in
this matter.

CFTC Orders CHS, Inc. and CHS Hedging, LLC to Pay $1 Million for Inaccurately Reporting
Positions in Corn and Soybeans

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against CHS, Inc. (CHS), a cooperative corporation for failing to comply with its legal
obligation to submit accurate monthly CFTC Form 204 Reports, regarding the composition of CHSâs fixed price cash corn
and soybean purchases and sales, in violation of the reporting requirements in CFTC Regulation 19.01. CHS is based in
Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota.

The CFTCâs Order also filed and simultaneously settled charges against CHS Hedging, LLC (CHS Hedging) (formerly CHS
Hedging, Inc.), a CFTC-registered Futures Commission Merchant. CHS Hedging willfully aided and abetted CHSâs
violations and is liable for CHSâs violations, the CFTC Order finds. CHS Hedging is headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota.

The CFTC Order requires CHS and CHS Hedging jointly to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist
from committing further violations of CFTC Regulation 19.01.

As the CFTC Order states, under CFTC Regulations all persons holding or controlling reportable futures and options
positions in certain agricultural commodities (including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal) and
any part of which constitute bona fide hedging positions as defined in CFTC Regulation 1.3(z), are required to file CFTC
Form 204 reports showing the composition of their fixed price cash position in each such commodity hedged. According
to the Order, a purpose of the Form 204 report is to check compliance with speculative position limits by ensuring that
filers that classify their futures positions as hedging actually own or control offsetting cash positions.

The Order finds that during the period from at least January 2000 until May 2013, CHS held reportable positions in Form
204 commodities and was required to file Form 204 reports showing the quantities of the fixed price purchase and sale
open cash positions of such commodities it hedged. The Order further finds that during this same period, CHS Hedging,
on behalf of CHS, filed consistently incorrect Form 204 reports on a monthly basis with the CFTC that did not accurately
state the quantities of CHSâs fixed price cash positions of each such commodity it hedged.

Consistent with this filing, the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight has issued an advisory regarding the obligation of
market participants to submit accurate Form 204 reports (see CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-42, Obligation of Reportable
Market Participants to File CFTC Form 204 Reports, which is linked in CFTC Press Release 6639-13, July 8, 2013).

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Jordon Grimm, Michelle Bougas, Andrew
Ridenour, Jennifer Diamond, James H. Holl Ill, Alison B. Wilson, and Rick Glaser. The Division of Market Oversight staff
members responsible for this matter are Matthew Hunter, Kenneth Danger, Harry Hild, Eugene Kunda, David Amato, and

CFTC Orders Former Hedge Fund Portfolio Manager to Pay More than $700,000 in
Monetary Sanctions for Fraudulently Mismarking Swaps

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against Swapnil Rege, a former portfolio manager for a Connecticut-based hedge fund registered with the CFTC
as a commodity pool operator (CPO), for fraudulently mismarking swap valuations to artificially inflate the profits of his
employerâs trading book in order to obtain an increased performance bonus.

The Order requires Rege to pay a $100,000 civil monetary penalty, as well as to disgorge the $600,000 performance
bonus he received (plus pre-judgment interest in the amount of $49,170.84). It also bans Rege from trading on or subject
to the rules of any CFTC-registered exchange or other CFTC-registered entity and from seeking registration with the CFTC
for at least three years, among other prohibitions.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, said: âWith this action, the Commission shows its continued
commitment to holding accountable individuals who engage in fraudulent conduct that undermines the integrity of our
markets. This Order also reflects the CFTCâs continued commitment to working in parallel with our enforcement partners
like the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that bad actors are identified and held accountable, even when
their misconduct stretches across multiple regulatorsâ jurisdictions.â

The Fraudulent Mismarking Scheme

The Order finds that from in or about June 2016 through April 2017, Rege engaged in a fraudulent scheme to mismark
the valuations of certain interest rate swaps in an attempt to artificially inflate the profitability of his trading in order to
earn a larger performance bonus. Rege accomplished his mismarking scheme in several ways, including by manipulating
the discount curve settings of the valuation model used by the CPO to mark its swaps and other related instruments, and
by using incorrect day count settings for fixed and floating legs of some swaps and swaptions to reduce or increase the
model value of future payments to or by the CPO. The Order also finds that Rege took steps to conceal his mismarking
scheme, including by asking counterpart traders at swap dealers used by the CPO to provide him with quotes to verify
the fraudulent model valuations. The Order finds that this conduct constituted fraud under the federal commodities
laws.

Related SEC Action

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also announced today that it filed and settled a related action against
Rege for aiding and abetting violations of the Investment Advisers Act by the fundâs investment adviser (the CFTC-
registered CPO was also registered with the SEC as an investment adviser). The SEC Order imposes disgorgement and
pre-judgment interest in amounts identical to the CFTC Order, as well as a $100,000 civil monetary penalty;
disgorgement amounts paid pursuant to the SEC Order shall offset (dollar-for-dollar) Regeâs obligation to pay
disgorgement under the CFTC Order.

CFTC Orders BNP Paribas Securities Corp. to Pay a $140,000 Penalty to Settle Charges of
Improper Investment of Customer Segregated Funds

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order instituting and
simultaneously settling charges against BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (BNPP), a registered Futures Commission
Merchant (FCM) based in New York, New York, for violating the CFTCâs Regulations governing concentration limits
applicable to the investment of segregated commodity customer funds. The CFTC Order requires BNPP to pay a $140,000
civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating CFTC Regulations, as charged. The Order also requires that
BNPP must regularly review its policies and procedures and provide training to ensure compliance with applicable
regulations.

The Order finds that on three occasions, in or about November and December 2014, BNPP violated the CFTC Regulations
governing concentration limits applicable to the investment of segregated commodity customer funds. BNPP reported
two of the violations to the CFTC and an additional violation was discovered by BNPPâs designated Self-Regulatory
Organization, CME Group Inc. On two of the three days, BNPP invested more than 10 percent of segregated customer
funds in an individual money market mutual fund, in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D), according to the Order.

The Order further finds that on two of the three days, BNPP invested more than 50 percent of segregated customer funds
in money market mutual funds, in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F).

The Order states that none of the violations resulted in any customer losses.

In the Order, the CFTC recognizes BNPPâs cooperation during the CFTCâs investigation and that BNPP voluntarily
undertook remedial action to strengthen its policies and procedures related to compliance with the applicable
regulations.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the CME Group Inc. in this matter.

The CFTCâs Division of Enforcement thanks Shoshana Feldman and Annette Vitale of the Division of Swap Dealer and
Intermediary Oversight. The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Neel Chopra,
Patryk J. Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr. and Manal M. Sultan.

The Order finds that on three occasions, in or about November and December 2014, BNPP violated the CFTC Regulations governing concentration limits applicable to the investment of segregated commodity customer funds. BNPP reported two of the violations to the CFTC and an additional violation was discovered by BNPP’s designated Self-Regulatory Organization, CME Group Inc. On two of the three days, BNPP invested more than 10 percent of segregated customer funds in an individual money market mutual fund, in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(ii)(D), according to the Order.

The Order further finds that on two of the three days, BNPP invested more than 50 percent of segregated customer funds in money market mutual funds, in violation of Regulation 1.25(b)(3)(i)(F).

The Order states that none of the violations resulted in any customer losses.

In the Order, the CFTC recognizes BNPP’s cooperation during the CFTC’s investigation and that BNPP voluntarily undertook remedial action to strengthen its policies and procedures related to compliance with the applicable regulations.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the CME Group Inc. in this matter.","The CFTC’s Division of Enforcement thanks Shoshana Feldman and Annette Vitale of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight.

CFTC Awards More Than $2 Million to Four Whistleblowers

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced a whistleblower award exceeding
$2 million to be shared among four whistleblowers. The CFTC granted the whistleblowersâ award applications for both a
CFTC action and related actions brought by another regulator. In issuing the award, the CFTC recognized the
contributions of the whistleblowers, who jointly submitted a tip to the CFTC. Each of the whistleblowers also individually
provided significant, ongoing assistance to the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement.

âIn many instances, whistleblowers are in the best position to identify suspicious conduct,â said CFTC Director of
Enforcement James McDonald. âThatâs precisely what happened in this case. After witnessing unusual activity, the
whistleblowers worked together to quickly submit a joint tip with sufficient detail that drew our attention to the potential
violations.â

âThe four whistleblowers here synthesized information for the CFTC that highlighted the economic impact of the
suspicious activity they identified,â said CFTC Whistleblower Office Director Christopher Ehrman. âThe whistleblowersâ
initiative not only led to the CFTCâs investigation, but also to related investigations brought by other regulators.â

About the CFTCâs Whistleblower Program

The CFTCâs Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010. Since issuing its first award in 2014, the CFTC has awarded approximately $100 million to
whistleblowers. CFTC actions associated with those awards have resulted in monetary relief totaling more than $800
million. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agencyâs enforcement actions, but also in connection with actions
brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.

The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the
CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a
whistleblowerâs identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not
disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount
of the award granted.

Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower
awards are paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely
through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured
customers to fund the program.

Anyone with information relating to potential violations of the CEA or the CFTCâs regulations, including possible violations
of commodity trading laws, can contact the CFTCâs Whistleblower Office via a toll-free hotline (866-873-5675), or can file

CFTC Charges Florida Resident Neil Pecker and His Company, Vision Financial Partners,
LLC, with Fraud in Connection with Off-Exchange Binary Options and Registration
Violations

Pecker and Vision Allegedly Solicited Nearly $3 Million from More than
120 Clients in the United States and Canada, While Misappropriating
almost $2 Million of the Funds for Their Personal Use

Court Order Freezes Defendantsâ Assets and Protects Books and
Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, charging Defendants Neil Pecker of
Longwood, Florida, and his company Vision Financial Partners, LLC (Vision) of Deerfield Beach, Florida, with fraud in
connection with off-exchange binary options. The CFTC Complaint also charges Vision and Pecker with acting as a
Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) and as an Associated Person of a CTA, respectively, without being registered with the
CFTC, as required.

The Complaint, filed under seal on February 16, 2016, also names as Relief Defendants Prometheus Enterprises,
Incorporated; Westward International Limited; Coucarin Holdings, Limited; all of Deerfield Beach, Florida; and
GDCM Trust of Las Vegas, Nevada, for allegedly receiving client funds without providing any legitimate services to
clients and without any interest or entitlement to such client funds.

Court Freezes Defendantsâ Assets

On February 19, 2016, U.S. District Court Judge James I. Cohn entered a Statutory Injunction freezing the assets of Pecker
and Vision, prohibiting them from destroying their books and records, and granting the CFTC immediate access to those
records.

The Complaint alleges that, from as early as October 2012 through the present, Vision, by and through its sole employee
and agent Pecker, and Pecker individually, have fraudulently solicited nearly $3 million from at least 120 members of the
public in the United States and Canada to trade off-exchange binary options by making misleading and false
misrepresentations and omissions of material facts to prospective and current clients. Furthermore, as alleged, the
Defendants misappropriated almost $2 million of client funds for their personal use in connection with their scheme by
transferring client funds to the Relief Defendants.

Binary options are options with discontinuous payoffs, either paying nothing or a considerable amount depending on the
satisfaction of some condition. According to the Complaint, Pecker and Vision failed to inform clients that their trading
accounts are with off-shore entities and that clients are unable to withdraw any funds from their binary options trading
accounts, including their principal investment, unless a minimum of trades occurred in their accounts. Pecker and Vision
also are alleged to have misappropriated and diverted almost $2 million of client funds to bank accounts in the names of
the Relief Defendants and for their own use. In addition to fraud, the Complaint charges that Pecker and Vision have
failed to register with the CFTC, as required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution to defrauded clients, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil
monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of clients to ensure
the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, St. Vincent and the
Grenadines - Financial Services Authority, Ontario Securities Commission, New Brunswick Securities Commission,
Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, British Columbia Securities Commission, Alberta Securities Commission, and the
British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission for their assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Eugenia Vroustouris, Michelle Bougas, Erica
Bodin, Elizabeth C. Padgett, Mary Q. Lutz, Elizabeth Davis, and Rick Glaser.

CFTC Orders New York Firm and its Trader to Pay $585,000 for Spoofing

September 28, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued two orders filing and settling charges
against Thomas Donino and his employer, FNY Partners Fund LP, for spoofingâbidding or offering with the intent to
cancel the bid or offer before execution. This case was brought in connection with the Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing
Task Force.

The order against Donino requires him to pay a $135,000 civil monetary penalty and suspends him for three months from
trading on or subject to the rules of any CFTC-designated exchange and all other CFTC registered entities and in all
commodity interests. It also orders him to cease and desist from violating the Commodity Exchange Actâs spoofing
prohibition. The order against FNY Partners Fund finds the firm vicariously liable for Doninoâs spoofing, which Donino
engaged in while a trader for FNY Partners Fund. The order against FNY Partners Fund requires it to pay a $450,000 civil
monetary penalty.

âThis enforcement action demonstrates the CFTCâs enhanced abilities to detect and prosecute spoofing using data
analytics,â said Division of Enforcement Director James McDonald. âThe CFTC will continue to identify and investigate
spoofing and hold accountable both individual traders and the firms that employ them.â

Case Background

According to the orders, between January 2013 and January 2016, Donino placed multiple orders in the Chicago Board of
Trade soybean futures, Commodity Exchange (COMEX) gold futures, and New York Mercantile Exchange crude oil futures
markets with the intent to cancel the orders before execution. Doninoâs trading pattern involved placing a small order,
typically for 10 or fewer contracts on one side of the market that he wanted to get filled (genuine order), and then
placing a larger order that he intended to cancel (Spoof order), typically for five times as many contracts as the genuine
order. Generally, Donino quickly canceled the spoof order after placing it, and often after his genuine order was filled.

Jordon Grimm, and Neel Chopra.

CFTC Orders UK Company to Pay Over $490,000 for Registration and Supervision
Violations

June 08, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Gain Capital UK Limited (Gain UK) of London, England for failing to register as a retail foreign exchange dealer
(RFED) and for supervision violations related to the handling of a customer account managed by an unregistered
commodity trading advisor (CTA). The order requires Gain UK to pay a $250,000 civil monetary penalty, to disgorge
$241,671, and to cease and desist from any further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or CFTC regulations,
as charged.

The order finds that from at least February 6, 2014 to March 8, 2019, Gain UK acted as a counterparty to retail foreign
exchange (forex) customers who were located in the United States, without registering as an RFED as required by the
CEA and CFTC regulations. Gain UK accepted customers who used U.S. mailing addresses in account applications and
provided documents such as lease agreements, utility bills, and health-insurance enrollment letters suggesting that they
were located in the United States. Furthermore, one customer informed a Gain UK employee that she was a student ata
U.S. university when questioned about her account application and U.S. mailing address. Nevertheless, Gain UK failed to
register as an RFED as required.

The order also finds that Gain UK failed to diligently supervise the handling of the account of a retail forex customer who
was located in the United States. Specifically, Gain UK failed to detect warning signs of the underlying fraudulent conduct
by an unregistered CTA who solicited the retail forex customer to open an account with Gain UK. For example, a Gain UK
employee had extensive communications with the unregistered CTA and was aware that the CTA had been rejected from
managing accounts with Gain UK and its affiliates because the CTA may have been soliciting managed accounts through
social media and a website without registering with the CFTC. Despite the unregistered CTA not being named on any of
the account documents, the CTA had extensive communications with Gain UKâs employee about creating the account,
directed the trading in it, and refunded commissions to the customer to reimburse significant trading losses. Due to the
unregistered CTAâs fraudulent conduct, the customer suffered approximately $280,000 in losses while Gain UK earned
$241,671.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority.

CFTC Charges Florida Company Mintco LLC and Florida Residents Stuart Rubin and
Richard Q. Zimmerman with Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals
Transactions and Defrauding Customers

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Mintco LLC of Delray Beach,
Florida, and its principals Stuart Rubin of Fort Lauderdale and Richard Q. Zimmerman of Wellington, Florida. The
CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal and fraudulent off-exchange transactions in precious
metals with retail customers. The Complaint further alleges that Rubin and Zimmerman controlled Mintco and are liable
as controlling persons for Mintcoâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, from July 16, 2011 to the present, Mintco, by and through its employees, agents, or officers,
including Rubin and Zimmerman, unlawfully solicited low net worth retail customers through telemarketing and Mintcoâs
website to buy or sell stored precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium on a fully paid or leveraged,
margined, or financed basis.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), transactions of this
nature are unlawful unless they result in actual delivery of metals within 28 days of the purchase or sale, and unless the
retail customers have sufficient net worth to be considered eligible contract participants (ECPs). According to the
Complaint, Mintcoâs customers did not qualify as ECPs; Mintco did not itself acquire, deliver, and store any financed metal
on behalf of its customers; and the transactions did not result in actual delivery of metal to Mintco customers within the
28-day time-frame required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the Complaint alleges that the Defendantsâ precious
metals transactions constituted unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions. The Complaint also alleges that
Mintco was not registered as a Futures Commission Merchant, as required under the CEA to offer those transactions.

The Complaint further alleges that Mintco defrauded retail customers by misrepresenting and omitting to disclose
material facts regarding 1) the past performance of the precious metals it marketed, 2) the price that the metals would
need to reach for the customers to break even on their purchases, and 3) the nature of the relationship between Mintco
and retail customers. According to the Complaint, Mintco charged customers commissions and fees that totaled as much
as 37.5 percent of the customerâs investment and failed to inform customers that in excess of 80 percent of customers
who purchased stored precious metal from it failed to cover their storage costs, interest charges, and other fees and earn
a profit on their investments.

Finally, the Complaint alleges that Mintco contracted with a third party, Worth Group Inc. (Worth), to manage its
obligations. However, according to the Complaint, those financed precious metals transactions marketed by Mintco did
not result in actual delivery within the prescribed 28-day window. The CFTC sued Worth in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Florida in August 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6666-13), charging Worth with engaging in illegal,
off-exchange precious metals transactions and other violations. On January 23, 2014, the District Court entered a
Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction enjoining Worth from violating anti-fraud provisions of the CEA.

In its continuing litigation against Mintco, Rubin, and Zimmerman, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,
restitution for the benefit of customers, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a
permanent injunction from future violations of the CEA, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Jon J. Kramer, Susan B. Padove, Joy H.
McCormack, Jeffrey Gomberg, Elizabeth M. Streit, David A. Terrell, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

",Release Number 7234-15,"September 17, 2015","CFTC Charges Florida Company Mintco LLC and Florida Residents Stuart Rubin and. Richard Q. Zimmerman with Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals. Transactions and Defrauding Customers.","Washington, DC — The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil enforcement Complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Mintco LLC of Delray Beach, Florida, and its principals Stuart Rubin of Fort Lauderdale and Richard Q. Zimmerman of Wellington, Florida. The CFTC Complaint charges the Defendants with engaging in illegal and fraudulent off-exchange transactions in precious metals with retail customers. The Complaint further alleges that Rubin and Zimmerman controlled Mintco and are liable as controlling persons for Mintco’s violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, from July 16, 2011 to the present, Mintco, by and through its employees, agents, or officers, including Rubin and Zimmerman, unlawfully solicited low net worth retail customers through telemarketing and Mintco’s website to buy or sell stored precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, and palladium on a fully paid or leveraged, margined, or financed basis.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), transactions of this nature are unlawful unless they result in actual delivery of metals within 28 days of the purchase or sale, and unless the retail customers have sufficient net worth to be considered eligible contract participants (ECPs). According to the Complaint, Mintco’s customers did not qualify as ECPs; Mintco did not itself acquire, deliver, and store any financed metal on behalf of its customers; and the transactions did not result in actual delivery of metal to Mintco customers within the 28-day time-frame required by the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, the Complaint alleges that the Defendants’ precious metals transactions constituted unlawful off-exchange retail commodity transactions. The Complaint also alleges that Mintco was not registered as a Futures Commission Merchant, as required under the CEA to offer those transactions.

The Complaint further alleges that Mintco defrauded retail customers by misrepresenting and omitting to disclose material facts regarding 1) the past performance of the precious metals it marketed, 2) the price that the metals would need to reach for the customers to break even on their purchases, and 3) the nature of the relationship between Mintco and retail customers. According to the Complaint, Mintco charged customers commissions and fees that totaled as much as 37.5 percent of the customer’s investment and failed to inform customers that in excess of 80 percent of customers who purchased stored precious metal from it failed to cover their storage costs, interest charges, and other fees and earn a profit on their investments.

Finally, the Complaint alleges that Mintco contracted with a third party, Worth Group Inc. (Worth), to manage its obligations. However, according to the Complaint, those financed precious metals transactions marketed by Mintco did not result in actual delivery within the prescribed 28-day window. The CFTC sued Worth in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in August 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6666-13), charging Worth with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions and other violations. On January 23, 2014, the District Court entered a Consent Order of Preliminary Injunction enjoining Worth from violating anti-fraud provisions of the CEA.

In its continuing litigation against Mintco, Rubin, and Zimmerman, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, restitution for the benefit of customers, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the CEA, as charged.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Jon J. Kramer, Susan B. Padove, Joy H.
 McCormack, Jeffrey Gomberg, Elizabeth M. Streit, David A. Terrell, Scott R. Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Charges Purported Hedge Fund Capitol Equity FX LLC and California Residents
Robert Leland Johnson IV and Marisa Elena Johnson with Fraud, Misappropriation, and
Registration Violations

Washington, DC -The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing of a civil
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Eastern Division, against Capitol
Equity FX LLC (Capitol Equity), a purported hedge fund operating in California, and its principals and agents, Robert
Leland Johnson IV and Marisa Elena Johnson, both of Chino, California (collectively, Defendants).

The CFTC Complaint, filed on April 19, 2017, charges Defendants with commodity futures fraud; off-exchange, leveraged
or margined retail foreign currency (forex) fraud; commodity pool fraud; and failure to register with the CFTC, as
required. The Complaint also charges Capitol Equity with engaging in activities prohibited for a commodity pool operator,
including commingling customer funds with Defendantsâ personal funds.

Misrepresentations and Material Omissions

According to the Complaint, from at least May 2012 through May 2015, Defendants fraudulently solicited at least
$1,735,750 from members of the public to participate in a pooled fund that traded commodity futures and forex
contracts. As alleged, the Defendants knowingly made material misrepresentations and omissions concerning their
trading abilities, strategies, and profits for the purpose of enticing pool participants to transfer funds to Defendants.

Defendants allegedly also created and provided pool participants with fabricated performance statements and account
documents designed to mislead pool participants. The Complaint further charges that these fraudulent documents falsely
reflected significant trading profits, concealed losses, and overstated account balances by millions of dollars.

Misappropriation of Pool Participantsâ Funds

The Complaint alleges that the Johnsons misappropriated all of pool participantsâ funds by paying their own personal
expenses, by depositing pool participantsâ funds into their personal bank accounts, and by trading pool participantsâ
funds in their personal trading accounts. As alleged, Defendants also diverted a portion of pool participantsâ funds to
earlier-in-time customers in the manner of a âPonziâ scheme.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains,
civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations
of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Daniel J. Grimm, Kyong J. Koh, Timothy J.

Fraud and Other Violations

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Assets and Protecting
Books and Records

Washington, DC âThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Chief Judge Kevin H.
Sharp of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee issued an emergency Order freezing and preserving
any remaining pool participant assets under the control of Maverick Asset Management, LLC, Rodney Scott Phelps,

The Order, entered under seal on August 25, 2015, also prohibits the Defendants from destroying books and records and
grants the CFTC immediate access to those records.

The Order arises out of a civil enforcement Complaint filed under seal by the CFTC on August 25, 2015, charging the
Defendants with fraudulently soliciting at least $1.2 million from members of the public to trade commodity futures in a
pool, misappropriating more than $800,000 of pool participantsâ funds for their personal use, and misrepresenting the
profitability of their trading. In addition to fraud, the Complaint charges the Defendants with operating a commodity pool
without being registered with the CFTC, as required.

The Complaint further alleges that the Defendants prepared and distributed to pool participants false account statements
that altered genuine statements the Defendants received from their futures broker, and that showed false profits, while,
at the same time, the Defendantsâ futures trading was consistently unprofitable.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, the payment of monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from
future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

CFTC Announces $6 Million Whistleblower Award
Latest Award Marks Milestone of $110 Million Awards Granted

June 09, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced it will award more than $6 million
to a whistleblower who voluntarily provided original information that led the CFTC to bring a successful enforcement
action. The CFTC opened its investigation upon receiving the whistleblowerâs information, which was specific, credible
and timely. With this award, the CFTC has now granted over $110 million in whistleblower awards since issuing its first
award in 2014.

âThis award â together with the many that have preceded it â shows that in its short history, the Commissionâs
Whistleblower Program has significantly strengthened our enforcement program,â said CFTC Director of Enforcement
James McDonald. âThe contribution that whistleblowers have made cannot be overstated. To use just one data point,
whistleblowers have led the CFTC to obtain nearly $900 million in monetary relief. We are very grateful for the value that
whistleblowers have added to our investigations and litigations.â

âSizeable awards like this one should signal to potential whistleblowers that there are real financial incentives to
promptly reporting violations to the CFTC,â added Whistleblower Office Director Christopher Ehrman.

About the CFTCâs Whistleblower Program

The CFTCâs Whistleblower Program was created under Section 748 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act of 2010. The CFTC issues awards related not only to the agencyâs enforcement actions, but also in
connection with actions brought by other domestic or foreign regulators if certain conditions are met.

The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides confidentiality protections for whistleblowers. Regardless of whether the
CFTC grants an award, the CFTC will not disclose any information that could reasonably be expected to reveal a
whistleblowerâs identity, except in limited circumstances. Consistent with this confidentiality protection, the CFTC will not
disclose the name of the enforcement action in which the whistleblower provided information or the exact dollar amount
of the award granted.

Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. All whistleblower
awards are paid from the CFTC Customer Protection Fund, which was established by Congress, and is financed entirely
through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA. No money is taken or withheld from injured
customers to fund the program.

CFTC Orders Pennsylvania Resident Robert M. McMahon to Pay $171,800 Civil Monetary
Penalty and Imposes Permanent Trading and Registration Bans for Engaging in Deceptive
Trade Allocation Scheme

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Robert M. McMahon of Mt. Pocono, Pennsylvania, for engaging in a deceptive
trading scheme involving Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures (NG) contracts, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX). The CFTC Order requires McMahon to pay a $171,800 civil monetary penalty and imposes permanent trading
and registration bans on him. The Order also requires McMahon to cease and desist from further violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

The Order finds that, in or about July 2010, McMahon engaged in a deceptive trading scheme that allocated to himself
futures contracts priced at better than market prices, while allocating to a customer futures contracts priced at worse
than market prices. To perpetuate the scheme, the customerâs NG orders were filled with noncompetitively executed
block trades, with McMahon taking the other side of the customerâs block trades. The Order further finds that these block
trades were executed at prices unfavorable to the customer but favorable to McMahon. Almost simultaneously, McMahon
executed for himself futures contracts on NYMEX at market prices that entirely offset his noncompetitively executed
block trades for a large profit. Further, according to the Order, with this structure â matching McMahon's
noncompetitively priced block trades almost immediately with offsetting, competitively priced market trades â the
scheme virtually guaranteed that McMahon profited, at the customerâs expense, on each block trade. On July 28, 2010,
McMahon improperly profited $171,800 from two such transactions, the Order finds.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the CME Group.

CFTC Orders Principal of Binary Options Trading Firm to Pay $200,000 for Illegal Off-
Exchange Trading and Registration Violations

Washington, DC-The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Curtis Dalton of Middleton, Massachusetts, requiring him to pay $200,000 for offering illegal off-exchange retail
commodity transactions to U.S. and overseas customers while failing to be registered by the CFTC as required.

The transactions offered by Dalton consisted of binary options in foreign currencies, which were required to be traded on
a designated contract market, an exempt board of trade, or a bona fide foreign board of trade. Instead, these contracts
were traded on a binary options trading platform operated by an unregistered British Virgin Islands company located in
Cyprus. In soliciting and accepting orders for such contracts, Dalton illegally operated as an unregistered futures
commission merchant.

Director of Enforcement James McDonald said, âThe requirement that these contracts be offered by registered entities on
a bona fide exchange is part of the CFTCâs comprehensive regulatory regime to protect the public from unscrupulous
trading outfits. We remind customers that they should do their homework on any firm they intend to use to trade in our
markets.â

In addition to requiring payment of a $200,000 civil monetary penalty, the CFTC order prohibits Dalton from ever trading
for others or soliciting and accepting funds from others for the purpose of trading any commodity interests.

The CFTC staff members responsible for this matter are Alan Edelman, Diana Dietrich, Daniel Jordan, Michael Loconte,

In addition to requiring payment of a $200,000 civil monetary penalty, the CFTC order prohibits Dalton from ever trading for others or soliciting and accepting funds from others for the purpose of trading any commodity interests.

CFTC Settles with TeraExchange LLC for Failing to Enforce Prohibitions on Wash Trading
and Prearranged Trading in Bitcoin Swap

Washington, D.C. - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against TeraExchange LLC (Tera), a provisionally registered Swap Execution Facility (SEF), for failing to
enforce its prohibition on wash trading and prearranged trading on the SEF platform. The CFTC Order requires Tera to
cease and desist from future violations relating to its obligations to enforce rules on trade practices. Tera is based in
Summit, New Jersey.

Specifically, the CFTC Order finds that Tera offered for trading on its SEF a non-deliverable forward contract based on the
relative value of the U.S. Dollar and Bitcoin, a virtual currency (the Bitcoin Swap). On October 8, 2014, the only two
market participants authorized at that time to trade on Teraâs SEF entered into two transactions in the Bitcoin Swap. The
transactions were for the same notional amount, price, and tenor, and had the effect of completely offsetting each other.
At the time, these were the only transactions on Teraâs SEF.

Tera arranged for the two market participants to enter into the transactions. Tera brought together the market
participants, telling one that the trade would be âto test the pipes by doing a round-trip trade with the same price in,
same price out, (i.e. no P/L [profit/loss] consequences) no custodian required,â according to the Order.

However, subsequent to the transactions, Tera issued a press release and made statements at a meeting of the CFTCâs
Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) announcing the transactions, creating the impression of actual trading
interest in the Bitcoin swap. Neither Teraâs press release nor the statements at the GMAC meeting indicated that the
October 8 transactions were pre-arranged wash sales executed for the purpose of testing Teraâs systems.

As a provisionally registered SEF, Tera is required under the SEF Core Principles of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA)
and CFTC Regulations to enact and enforce rules prohibiting certain types of trade practices on the SEF, including wash
trading and prearranged trading. Teraâs rulebook, in fact, prohibited those practices.

The CFTC noted in the Order that â[t]hese facts should be distinguished from a situation where a SEF or other designated
contract market runs pre-operational test trades to confirm that its systems are technically capable of executing
transactions and, to the extent that these simulated transactions become publicly known, makes it clear to the public
that the trades do not represent actual liquidity in the subject market.â

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Division of Market Oversight.

The Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Andrew Ridenour, Kim Bruno, Daniel Jordan, and
Rick Glaser.

CFTC Orders Atlantas Group, Inc. and Edmund Hysni to Pay in Total $7.2 Million in
Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty for Solicitation Fraud and for Making False
Statements to the National Futures Association

Order Also Permanently Bars Atlantas Group and Hysni from the
Commodity Industry

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Respondents Atlantas Group, Inc. (Atlantas) and Edmund Hysni for
committing solicitation fraud in connection with options on futures contracts trading on the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Commodity Exchange, Inc., and against Hysni for willfully making material false statements to the National Futures
Association (NFA) in connection with its investigation of the fraud.

Hysni, who resides in Waterford, Michigan, was the sole owner and president of Atlantas, which had its principal place of
business in Waterford. Neither is currently registered with the CFTC.

The CFTC Order requires Atlantas and Hysni, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of $5 million and a $2.2 million civil
monetary penalty; permanently prohibits them from trading on any registered entity, as defined in the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA), or registering with the CFTC; and bars them permanently from engaging in any commodity-related
activities. The Order also requires them to cease and desist from violating the provisions of the CEA and CFTC
Regulations, as charged.

Clients Lost Most of Their Money in the Fraudulent Scheme

The Order finds that, between 2006 and 2012, Atlantas, a registered Introducing Broker between March 2006 and June
2013, and Hysni, a registered Associated Person between February 2006 and June 2013, falsely represented to their
customers that 1) they would return approximately 300% of their customersâ initial investments, 2) their investment
strategy was safe and conservative, and 3) they had a track record of success. The Order finds that, instead, Atlantas and
Hysni invested their clientsâ money in out-of-the-money option spreads resulting in their customers losing most of their
money. Furthermore, Atlantas collected approximately 90% of its clientsâ losses in commissions while misrepresenting
the effect of such commissions, the Order finds. Specifically, Atlantas and Hysni failed to disclose to their customers the
effect on customersâ profits or losses of Respondentsâ trading strategy and the commissions that Atlantas was charging
customers, according to the Order.

False Statements to the NFA

In addition, the Order finds that Hysni, who controlled and acted for Atlantas, willfully made material false statements to
the NFA in connection with NFAâs investigation of Atlantasâ and Hysniâs fraud. In the course of its investigation, NFA
questioned Hysni about money that Atlantas paid to an unregistered Associated Person, and Hysni provided false
information regarding those payments, the Order finds.

The Order further finds that Hysni is liable for Atlantasâ violations as its President, owner, and controlling person and that
Atlantas is liable for Hysniâs violations because Hysni was acting for Atlantas within the scope of his employment or office
with Atlantas when he committed his violations.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the NFA for its assistance.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Neel Chopra, Christopher Giglio, Patryk J.
Chudy, Lenel Hickson, Jr., and Manal M. Sultan.

CFTC Finds that The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. Engaged in Spoofing of Treasury
Futures and Eurodollar Futures

CFIC Recognizes The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.âs Cooperation,
Self-Reporting, and Pro-Active Implementation of Remedial Measures
and Process Improvements

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU) for engaging in multiple acts of spoofing in a variety
of futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, including futures contracts
based on United States treasury notes and Eurodollars. The Order finds that BTMU engaged in this activity through one of
its employees (Trader A), who accessed these markets through a trading platform from one of BTMUâs Tokyo offices. The
Order requires BTMU to pay a $600,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from violating the Commodity
Exchange Actâs prohibition against spoofing. The CFTC became aware of the conduct through BTMUâs voluntary self-
reporting of the wrongdoing.

CFTCâs Director of Enforcement Comments

âThis case shows the benefits of self-reporting and cooperation, which | anticipate being an important part of our
enforcement program going forward,â said James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement. McDonald continued:
âWe expect market participants, through adequate supervision, to prevent this sort of misconduct before it starts. But
when market participants discover wrongdoing, we want to incentivize them to voluntarily report it and to cooperate with
our investigation, as the Bank of Tokyo did here. The Bank of Tokyo benefitted from its self-reporting and cooperation in
the form of a substantially reduced penalty.â

CFTCâs Order

The Order finds that during the period starting at least July 2009 through December 2014, although largely in 2010 and
2011, Trader A placed multiple orders for futures contracts with an intent to cancel the orders before their execution.
Trader Aâs spoofing strategies included submitting orders on opposite sides of the same market at nearly the same time.
The Order further finds that Trader A engaged in this spoofing activity in order to move the market in a direction
favorable to his orders. Once aware of Trader Aâs misconduct, BTMU promptly suspended the trader and reported the
conduct to the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement (the Division).

The Order makes additional findings about BTMUâs self-reporting, cooperation, and remediation. The Order finds that
BTMU commenced an expansive internal review and assisted the Divisionâs investigation of the conduct. The Order
further finds that BTMU launched an overhaul of its systems and controls and implemented a variety of enhancements to
detect and prevent similar misconduct. The Order additionally finds that BTMU revised its policies, updated its training,
and implemented electronic systems to identify spoofing.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Kara Mucha, Jordon Grimm, Laura
Brookover, Philip Tumminio, and Rick Glaser.

CFTC Charges Introducing Broker eFloorTrade, LLC and its Principal John Moore with
Recordkeeping and Supervision Failures and Charges Moore for his False and Misleading
Statements to the CFTC

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York against eFloorTrade, LLC (eFloorTrade) and its majority owner and
sole principal John Moore, charging them with recordkeeping and supervision failures and charging Moore with making
false and misleading statements of material fact, or omitting material facts, in sworn testimony before the CFTC.
eFloorTrade, headquartered in Orlando, Florida, is registered with the CFTC as an Introducing Broker, and Moore, also of
Orlando, is registered with the CFTC as an Associated Person of eFloorTrade.

The CFTC Complaint, filed on September 27, 2016, alleges that, from October 2010 to at least October 2015, eFloorTrade
failed to keep and produce for inspection full, complete, and systematic records of all transactions relating to its business
in dealing in commodity interests.

According to the Complaint, eFloorTrade failed to keep and produce for inspection the trading instructions it electronically
received for customers who subscribed to third party trading systems for which eFloorTrade provided execution services.
The Complaint further alleges that eFloorTrade also failed to prepare a written record of the customer orders that it
placed (filled, unfilled, or cancelled) as a result of the trading instructions received. In addition, the Complaint alleges that
eFloorTrade failed to keep all emails relating to its business of dealing in commodity interest transactions.

According to the Complaint, eFloorTrade and Moore failed to diligently supervise the handling of customersâ trading
accounts by eFloorTrade employees and agents. The Complaint alleges that eFloorTrade and Moore failed to ensure that
policies and procedures were in place to make and keep books and records that eFloorTrade is required to make and
keep as a CFTC registrant and failed to adopt adequate procedures on how to handle its customersâ margin deficiencies.
These supervision failures, according to the Complaint, also contributed to recordkeeping violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations described above.

Further, according to the Complaint, on September 18, 2015, Moore knew or reasonably should have known that certain
of his statements to the CFTC while testifying under oath were false and misleading. The Complaint alleges that Moore
falsely testified that he, or another eFloorTrade employee working under his direct supervision, created and maintained
spreadsheets relating to trades executed on behalf of customers whose orders were generated from trading instructions
received from third party trading system providers. However, as the Complaint also alleges, EFT made or kept no such
records, as Moore and EFT, through counsel, later admitted.

The Complaint seeks relief including disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans, and
permanent injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Karin N. Roth, Christopher Giglio, Alejandra
de Urioste, Steven I. Ringer, Lenel Hickson, Jr. and Manal Sultan.

CFTC Charges Florida Resident Dorian A. Garcia and his Companies, DG Wealth
Management, Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP with Fraud and
Registration Violations

Garcia Allegedly Operated a Ponzi Scheme in Connection with Forex and
Options Pools and Stole Approximately $2.5 Million Invested by
Customers

Federal Court Enters Emergency Order Freezing Defendantsâ Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Judge Sheri Polster
Chappell of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered an emergency restraining Order freezing
assets and prohibiting the destruction or concealment of books and records of Defendants Dorian A. Garcia, and his
companies, DG Wealth Management (DG Wealth), Macroquantum Capital LLC, and UKUSA Currency Fund LP, all
of Naples, Florida. The judge set a hearing date for April 29, 2015.

The Courtâs Order arises from a CFTC Complaint filed under seal on April 14, 2015, charging the Defendants with fraud in
connection with their solicitation of customers for their foreign currency (forex) and options trading pools,
misappropriation of customer funds, and their issuance of false statements and registration violations, in violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations.

According to the CFTC Complaint, the Defendants fraudulently solicited approximately $4.7 million from at least 80
customers to invest in forex and options pools beginning as early as May 2010. The Complaint alleges that Garcia made a
number of misrepresentations to those he solicited, including: (1) falsely promising them that their principal was
protected with a large collateral account; (2) misrepresenting the total amount of funds he had under management; (3)
falsely reporting large profits in existing trading accounts; and (4) failing to disclose that he misappropriated investor
funds. Many of Garciaâs misrepresentations were contained within bank and trading firm account statements that he
emailed to investors that were falsified to reflect exaggerated account balances.

The CFTC Complaint alleges that Garcia returned nearly $2.1 million to investors in a manner akin to a Ponzi scheme and
misappropriated approximately $2.5 million of investor funds. Garcia used the misappropriated funds for his personal and
business expenses such as art, domestic help, jewelry, and cash transfers to his personal bank accounts, according to the
Complaint.

The Complaint also alleges that Garcia and DG Wealth acted in capacities requiring them to register with the
Commission, but were not registered with the CFTC, as required.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading
and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, Bureau of Financial Investigations,
Miami, Florida.

Commodity Pool Operator Sentenced to 17 Yearsâ Incarceration for Fraud

Washington, DC â Donovan Davis Jr., one of three Principal Defendants charged by the CFTC for the fraudulent
operation of Capital Blu Management, LLC of Melbourne, Florida, was sentenced to 17 years in a federal prison on
August 27, 2015.

Davis was convicted on May 14, 2015 of multiple counts of criminal conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, and money
laundering in connection with the operation of a fraudulent $17 million commodity pool. The two other Co-Defendants in
the CFTC action, Blayne Davis and Damien Bromfield, earlier pleaded guilty to similar criminal charges. B. Davis was
sentenced to 9 years in prison; Bromfieldâs sentencing is scheduled for September 24.

CFTC Enforcement Director, Aitan Goelman, said âThese sentences serve as a strong reminder that those who engage in
fraud in the commodities markets face the very real possibility of criminal prosecution and jail time in addition to the civil
sanctions sought by the CFTC.â

In 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida found these same Defendants liable for civil violations of
the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations and ordered them to pay more than $7 million each in restitution
and civil monetary penalties and permanently barred them from engaging in any commodity-related activity (see CFTC
Press Release, Order, and Judgment 6054-11, June 15, 2011, and CFTC Press Release and Complaint 5643-09, April 7,
2009).

The CFTC subsequently provided material assistance to the U.S. Attorneyâs office responsible for the criminal prosecution
of these Defendants.

CFTC Charges California Residents Christopher Valois and Cynthia Wong and Their
Companies with Fraud and Registration Violations

Husband and wife team allegedly stole more than $300,000 of the
$750,000 their customers invested

Federal court enters emergency Order freezing Defendantsâ assets and
protecting books and records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Cormac J.
Carney of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an emergency restraining Order freezing
assets and prohibiting the destruction or concealment of books and records of Defendants Christopher Valois, Cynthia
Wong, and their companies, Bertram Trade LLC (Bertram) and Churchhill Commodities Trading LLC (Churchhill),
all of Orange County California. The judge set a hearing date for February 12, 2015.

The courtâs Order arises from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 28, 2015, charging the Defendants with precious metals
and futures fraud, misappropriation, engaging in illegal off-exchange precious metals transactions, and registration
violations, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC Regulations from October 2011 to the present.

According to the Complaint, husband and wife Valois and Wong, acting by and through Bertram and Churchhill,
fraudulently solicited approximately $450,000 from six customers, some of whom were senior citizens, to purchase
precious metals or engage in futures trading. The Complaint states that the precious metals transactions offered by
Valois and Wong and their companies were illegal off-exchange instruments and alleges that Valois and Wong
misappropriated more than $300,000 of customer money to pay their personal expenses.

The Complaint also alleges that Valois and Wong acted as Commodity Trading Advisors by trading another $300,000 of at
least four members of the general public in futures contracts and receiving advisory fees for such futures trading, even
though they were not registered with the CFTC, as required. In fact, Valois previously had been banned from the futures
industry for cheating and defrauding customers, according to the Complaint.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, trading
and registration bans, and a permanent injunction against further violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the National Futures Association in this matter.

CFTC Orders Ikon Global Markets, Inc. to Pay $200,000 for Recordkeeping Violations

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Ikon Global Markets, Inc. (Ikon) for failing to keep and promptly produce
documentation for thousands of gold Exchange for Physical (EFP) trades, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA) and CFTC Regulations. The trades were entered into by Ikon and reported to the NASDAQ OMX Futures Exchange,
Inc. (NFX).

The CFTC Order requires Ikon to pay a $200,000 civil monetary penalty, to cease and desist from further violations of the
CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged, and to withdraw from, and never apply for, registration with the CFTC.

Ikon is a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM) incorporated and with a business address in New York, New York.

Specifically, the Order finds that from February 9, 2012, through September 12, 2012, Ikon, for a proprietary account,
entered into thousands of EFP transactions with one of its customers, which were reported to the NFX. These EFP
Transactions involved a privately negotiated and simultaneous exchange of a position in the XAU/USD Spot Gold Futures
contract (NAU contract) for a corresponding and offsetting cash position in gold. As an FCM, Ikon was required to keep
full, complete and systematic records relevant to its dealings in the NAU contract and any related cash positions,
including all orders, copies of confirmations, and copies of statements of purchase and sale.

On March 18, 2015, the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement (Division) issued a subpoena requesting that Ikon produce, for
certain accounts including the Ikon proprietary account and the relevant customer account, all documents related to
transactions in the NAU contract, including, among other things, all orders. In the subpoena, Division staff also requested
all documents reflecting any cash or other related position or the transfer of any cash or other related position in
connection with any off-exchange transactions related to the NAU contract (i.e., the EFP Transactions). Further, according
to the Order, on May 8, 2015, Ikon produced daily records reflecting the end of day positions in NAU contracts but did not
produce records relevant to the EFP Transactions or other transactions involving the NAU contract.

On August 30, 2016, Division staff issued to Ikon a second subpoena which identified seven specific EFP transactions and
requested certain documents regarding those transactions. Ikon produced certain additional documents for those seven
transactions; however, its production did not include certain documents requested, such as customer orders, copies of
confirmations, or copies of statements of purchase or sale, according to the Order. Division staff, by letter dated February
24, 2017, requested that all outstanding documents requested be produced by no later than March 17, 2017. Ikon failed
to produce further documentation, the Order finds.

The CFTC thanks the National Futures Association, the NASDAQ Futures, Inc., and the Securities Commission of The
Bahamas for their assistance in this matter.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Xavier Romeu-Matta, Lara Turcik,
Christopher Giglio, Patryk Chudy, Lenel Hickson, and Manal Sultan.

Federal Court in Chicago Orders U.K. Resident Navinder Singh Sarao to Pay More than $38
Million in Monetary Sanctions for Price Manipulation and Spoofing

Sarao Admits to Contributing to Extreme Order Book Imbalance and
Causing and Creating Artificial Prices on Multiple Days, Including May
6, 2010 (Flash Crash Day)

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Andrea R.
Wood of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a Consent Order against Navinder Singh
Sarao (Sarao) that requires him to pay a $25,743.174.52 civil monetary penalty and $12,871,587.26 in disgorgement.
The Courtâs Order also permanently prohibits Sarao from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and
CFTC Regulations, as charged, and imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Sarao.

The Courtâs Order arises from a CFTC enforcement action filed against Sarao, along with his company Nav Sarao
Futures Limited PLC (Defendants). The CFTC charged them with unlawfully manipulating, attempting to manipulate,
spoofing, and use of a manipulative device â all with regard to the E-mini S&P 500 near month futures contract (E-mini
S&P) that trades on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) (see the CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7156-15, April
21,2015). The E-mini S&P 500 is a stock market index futures contract based on the Standard & Poorâs 500 Index and is
one of the most popular and liquid equity index futures contracts in the world.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Aitan Goelman commented:

âAs this case makes clear, the dangers of spoofing are real. Mr. Sarao's spoof orders distorted prices in the E-mini time
and time again over a period of years. In so doing, his orders hurt real market participants. Equally as clear is our
resolve to root out this behavior and bring those responsible to justice, wherever they may be.â

In the Order, Sarao admits to the allegations in the CFTC Complaint, as well as to the Orderâs findings of fact and the
conclusions of law. The Order finds that Sarao:

* successfully manipulated the E-mini S&P on at least 12 days between April 27, 2010 and March 10, 2014
(including May 6, 2010, commonly known as Flash Crash Day);

Â¢ attempted to manipulate the E-mini S&P tens of thousands of times between April 2010 and April 17, 2015;

* placed tens of thousands of bids and offers that he intended to cancel before execution (/.e., spoof orders)
between July 16, 2011 and April 17, 2015; and

* employed or attempted to employ a manipulative device, scheme, or artifice to defraud in connection with his
spoof orders between August 15, 2011 and April 17, 2015.

The Order finds that Sarao engaged in a scheme to manipulate the price of the E-mini S&P utilizing a variety of
automated and manual spoofing tactics designed to cause price swings that Defendants could exploit through their
trading. For example, Defendants used a dynamic layering program that routinely placed 4 to 6 exceptionally large sells
orders into the E-mini S&P order book, each one price point from the next, beginning at least 3 or 4 price points away
from the best asking price. As the market price moved, the program automatically and simultaneously modified the
orders at the various price levels, resulting in Defendantsâ orders generally remaining at least 3 or 4 price points away
from the best asking price in the order book. Often, these large layered orders were modified hundreds of times to keep
them from resulting in executed trades, before eventually being cancelled. Defendants also sometimes employed a back-
of-queue program that placed large orders in the order book to affect prices, but minimized the chances that such orders
would result in executed trades by taking advantage of the CME matching functionality. Further, according to the Order,
Defendants utilized manual spoofing techniques to place and cancel large orders with no intention of execution.

According to the Order, Defendants placed thousands of E-mini S&P spoof orders to create a materially false and
misleading impression of supply and demand to induce other market participants to react and buy or sell E-mini S&P
contracts at prices, quantities, and/or times that, but for Defendantsâ spoofs orders, these other market participants
would not have traded. Further, the spoof orders had the purpose and effect of artificially depressing or artificially
inflating E-mini S&P market prices when the spoof orders were active. Frequently, after causing these artificial prices,
Defendants executed orders that benefited from these artificial prices.

Flash Crash Day (May 6, 2010)
Defendants admitted to aggressively using the dynamic layering program and other spoof orders on May 6, 2010,
according to the Order. More specifically, the Order finds that Defendants used the dynamic layering program for a
cumulative time of over 4 hours and 25 minutes on the Flash Crash Day. The program placed orders that were modified
over 81,000 times that day, with only 81 lots resulting in executed trades. Before being cancelled at 1:40 p.m. CT, the
orders represented approximately $170 million to over $200 million worth of persistent downward pressure on the E-mini
S&P price and represented 20-29% of the entire sell-side of the order book. Further, Defendants placed additional resting
spoof orders in the order book to exacerbate the effects of the dynamic layering program. The Order also finds that
Defendantsâ actions contributed to an extreme order book imbalance in the E-mini S&P market and that the CFTCâs and
Securities and Exchange Commissionâs Preliminary Findings Regarding the Events of May 6, 2010 noted that the
significant imbalance between sell orders and buy orders contributed to a sudden loss of liquidity in the E-mini S&P
market that day and that this loss of liquidity, in conjunction with other market events, directly contributed to the E-mini
S&P price crash.

Related Criminal Action

Last week, Sarao pleaded guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to one count of spoofing and
one count of wire fraud in a related criminal action.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Jeff Le Riche, Jo Mettenburg, Jenny
Chapin, Allison Sizemore, Carlin Metzger, Elizabeth Padgett, Mary Lutz, Jordon Grimm, Rick Glaser, and Charles Marvine,
as well as former Division of Enforcement staff member Jessica Harris.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the U.S. Department of Justice,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the Guernsey Financial Services Commission,
and the Metropolitan Police International Assistance Unit, Scotland Yard. The CFTC also recognizes the cooperation of the

Trader Admits to Manipulative and Illegal Conduct, Enters into a Cooperation Agreement

March 25, 2021

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against Emilio JosÃ© Heredia Collado of Lafayette, California for engaging in attempted manipulation and manipulation
of a U.S. price-assessment benchmark relating to physical fuel oil products. Heredia engaged in this unlawful conduct for
more than four years while employed as a fuel oil trader at a commodity trading firm and then at the US. affiliate of a
multinational commodity trading company that acquired it.

Heredia admits the facts of his manipulation and acknowledges that his conduct violated the Commodity Exchange Act
(CEA) and CFTC regulations.

The order permanently bans Heredia from trading commodity interests and requires him to comply with undertakings
never to engage in other commodity-interest related activities, including applying for registration and acting as a
principal, agent, officer or employee of any person registered, required to be registered, or exempt from registration. The
order also imposes a $100,000 civil monetary penalty.

âThis enforcement action demonstrates that manipulation of energy prices will not be tolerated, and the CFTC will
aggressively protect market participants who rely on the integrity of commodity benchmarks,â said Acting Director of
Enforcement Vincent McGonagle.

In a separate, parallel matter, the Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section today announced a criminal charge against
Heredia in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. [See United States v. Heredia, Case No. 21-CR-
0109 (N.D. Cal.)] Heredia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to manipulate the price of a commodity in interstate
commerce in violation of the CEA.

Commodity Pool and its President Ordered to Pay $1.2 Million, Banned from Markets for
Futures Fraud

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that a Virginia federal court
has entered a Consent Order (Order) resolving a CFTC action against defendants The Kane Capital Investment
Group, LLC and its President, Amrit Jaswant Singh Chahal (together, defendants), both of Virginia. The Order results
from a CFTC Complaint charging the defendants with commodity futures fraud, commodity pool fraud, registration
violations, and illegally commingling funds (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7712-18, dated April 13, 2018).

The Order requires the defendants to pay $1,232,510.41 in restitution and imposes permanent trading and registration
bans as well as prohibiting Chahal from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations.
The Order provides that the restitution obligation is deemed satisfied by entry of a criminal forfeiture judgment of an
equal or greater amount in the case of United States v. Amrit Jaswant Singh Chahal, Case No. 1:18-cr-00152-LMB (E.D.
Va. 2018) (the Criminal Action).

According to the Order, from at least January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2017, the defendants fraudulently solicited
and misappropriated customer funds in connection with offers to trade E-mini NASDAQ 100, E-mini S&P 500, Cboe
Volatility Index, and NYMEX WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil futures contracts, among others. The Order further finds that the
defendantsâ trading was on balance unprofitable, causing deep losses that they attempted to conceal by making material
misrepresentations and omissions to pool participants. For example, the defendants touted annual averaged trading
profits of between 28% and 34%, and sometimes higher, despite knowing at the time that Kane Capital made no profits
and was suffering losses. Chahal also doctored trading account statements for the purpose of concealing losses and
attracting additional pool participants.

The Order also finds that the defendants misappropriated pool funds by using new deposits to make Ponzi scheme-like
payments to certain pool participants and by using the funds to pay Chahalâs personal expenses, including his rent,
utility, and credit card bills.

Related Criminal and SEC Actions

On November 2, 2018, Chahal pleaded guilty to wire fraud and commodities fraud charges in the Criminal Action. On
March 15, 2019, the Court sentenced Chahal to 30 months in federal prison and entered an Amended Preliminary Order
of Forfeiture requiring him to pay a criminal forfeiture judgment in the amount of $1,232,510.41.

In addition to the Criminal Action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Chahal in a related
enforcement action. See SEC v. Amrit /.S. Chahal, Case No. 1:18-cv-00426 (E.D. Va. 2018).

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Virginia State
Corporation Commission, and the SEC Division of Enforcement.

CFTC Restricts Registration of Steven A. Cohen Based on Failure to Supervise

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it filed a Notice of
Intent (Notice) to revoke, suspend, or place restrictions on the registration of Steven A. Cohen (Cohen) of Greenwich,
Connecticut. The CFTC simultaneously issued an Opinion and Order (CFTC Order) accepting Cohenâs Offer of Settlement
and settling the action. The CFTC Order immediately restricted Cohen's registration as an Associated Person (AP) of SAC
Capital Advisors, L.P. (SAC LP). Additionally, pursuant to the Order, Cohen agreed not to engage in any activity requiring
registration with the CFTC or to act as an officer or employee of any person registered or required to be registered with
the CFTC until at least December 31, 2017, contemporaneous with the restriction end date set forth in a Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) order of January 8, 2016 (SEC Order).

The CFTC Order finds that on January 8, 2016, the SEC entered an Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions Pursuant to Section 203(f) of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 (the SEC Order), in which the SEC found that
Cohen had âfailed reasonably to supervise [an employee] with a view to preventing [that employeeâs] violation of Section
10(b) of the [Securities] Exchange Act [of 1934] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.â Cohen consented to the SEC Order, without
admitting or denying the findings therein. The SEC Order included a finding that Cohen ignored red flags, failed to take
prompt action to determine whether Matthew Martoma, a portfolio manager who reported to Cohen, was engaged in
unlawful insider trading conduct, and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent violations of the federal securities laws.
The CFTCâs Order finds that Cohen is subject to statutory disqualification from registration with the CFTC pursuant to
Sections 8a(3)(C) and 8a(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act and restricts Cohenâs registration under the terms set forth
in the Order.

CFTC Division of Enforcement Staff members responsible for this matter include Michael P. Geiser, K. Brent Tomer, Lenel
Hickson, and Manal M. Sultan.

Federal Court Orders Banc de Binary Ltd., ET Binary Options Ltd., BO Systems Ltd., BDB
Services Ltd., and Oren Shabat Laurent to Pay More than $9 Million in Restitution and a
Civil Monetary Penalty for Violating the CFTCâs Ban on Trading Binary Options Off-
Exchange

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that a federal court in Las
Vegas, Nevada, issued a Consent Order requiring Defendants Oren Shabat Laurent of Israel and his companies E.T.
Binary Options, Ltd. of Israel, Banc de Binary, Ltd. of Cyprus, BO Systems, Ltd. of the Seychelles, and BDB
Services, Ltd. of the Seychelles (collectively, Banc de Binary) to pay $7.1 million in restitution to U.S. customers who
traded the illegal, off-exchange options (in this case, binary options) offered by the Defendants. The Defendants were
also ordered to pay a $2 million civil monetary penalty. The Order also imposed a permanent ban on offering or trading
any further off-exchange binary options to U.S. customers.

The Order, entered on February 26, 2016, stems from a CFTC complaint filed June 5, 2013 (see CFTC Press Release 6602-
13) and amended May 6, 2014 (see CFTC Press Release 6923-14), charging the Defendants with violating the CFTCâs ban
on off-exchange options trading by offering commodity option contracts to U.S. customers for trading, as well as
soliciting, accepting orders and funds from, or confirming the execution of orders from U.S. customers. Through the Banc
de Binary website, customers buy or sell binary âcallâ or âputâ options that allow them to predict whether the price of a
certain âassetâ will go âupâ or âdownâ at a future date and/or time, with a specified payout structure.

In the Order, the Court found that the corporate Defendants acted as the counterparty to their customersâ binary options
transactions on a variety of assets, including commodities (e.g., wheat, oil, gold, platinum, sugar, coffee, corn, etc.), forex
pairs (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, etc.), and stock indices (e.g., S&P 500 and NASDAQ futures). The Court further
found that the Defendantsâ customers were not eligible contract participants (/e., the Defendantsâ customers were retail
customers). These transactions, the Court found, violated federal laws prohibiting the trading of options off-exchange.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also resolved its pending litigation against the
Defendants. SEC v. Banc de Binary, Ltd., et. a/., 2:13-cv-00993-RCJ-VCF. As a result of the CFTC and SEC Orders, the
Defendants are required to pay more than $9 Million to U.S. customers.

The CFTC thanks the SEC in this matter for its cooperation. The CFTC also thanks the Cyprus Securities and Exchange
Commission, Israel Securities Authority, Ontario Securities Commission, Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority,
and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority for their assistance in this matter.

CFTC staff members responsible for this case are Margaret Aisenbrey, Kim Bruno, Michelle Bougas, Erica Bodin, Jessica
Harris, Nate Gueltzau, Joyce Brandt, Mary Lutz, Tom Leahy, Duane Andresen, Kathleen Banar, and Rick Glaser.

Monitor Contact Information

The CFTC has posted on its website information regarding the restitution distribution process (see the CFTCâs Banc De
Binary Litigation Case Study Report). In addition, the court-appointed Monitor, the National Futures Association, will post
information and current updates regarding the case on its website (see NFAâs Banc De Binary Restitution Information).

The CFTC cautions customers that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the
wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of
customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Orders Florida-Based Midwest Metals Exchange and Its Owner, Brian S. Ekasala, to
Pay Restitution and a Civil Monetary Penalty Totaling More than $522,000 for Engaging in
Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Brian S. Ekasala, a resident of Lake Worth, Florida, and his company, Midwest
Metals Exchange, LLC (Midwest) of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals
transactions.

The CFTC Order requires Ekasala and Midwest jointly to pay restitution totaling $322,852.71 and a $200,000 civil
monetary penalty. The Order further imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Ekasala and Midwest and
requires them to cease and desist from violating Section 4(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act.

As explained in the Order, financed transactions in commodities with retail customers, like those engaged in by Ekasala
and Midwest, must be executed on or subject to the rules of an exchange approved by the CFTC. The CFTC Order finds
that, from July 2011 through March 2013, Midwest solicited retail customers to buy and sell precious metals, which were
executed through Hunter Wise Commodities, LLC (Hunter Wise). Midwest telemarketers represented that a customer
could purchase precious metals with just a 30 percent deposit, and that the customer would receive a loan for the
remaining 70 percent, according to the Order. In addition to interest on the âloan,â the customer also had to pay a
commission and a mark-up on the total value of the metal. Neither Midwest nor Hunter Wise bought, sold, loaned, stored,
or transferred any physical metals for these transactions. Neither Midwest nor Hunter Wise actually delivered any
precious metals to any customer. Notwithstanding the fact that no physical metal was involved, Midwest's transactions
were illegal because they were not executed on a registered exchange.

The CFTC sued Midwestâs clearing firm, Hunter Wise, in federal court in Florida on December 5, 2012. The CFTC charged
Hunter Wise with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, as well as fraud and other violations (see
CFTC Press Release 6447-12). On February 25, 2013, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Hunter Wise,
froze the firmâs assets, and appointed a corporate monitor to assume control over those assets (see CFTC Press Release
6522-13).

The Order states that Ekasala owned and operated Midwest and controlled its day-to-day operations, with exclusive
authority over the hiring and supervision of Midwest telemarketers.

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure that the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Michael Amakor, Todd Kelly, Peter M. Haas,
and Paul G. Hayeck.

CFTC Orders Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to Pay $70 Million Penalty for Attempted
Manipulation of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling charges
against Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (DBSI) for attempted manipulation of the ISDAFIX benchmark and requiring
DBSI to pay a $70 million civil monetary penalty.

The CFTC Order finds that over a five-year period, beginning in at least January 2007 and continuing through May 2012
(the Relevant Period), DBSI made false reports and through the acts of multiple traders attempted to manipulate the U.S.
Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a leading global benchmark referenced ina
range of interest rate products, to benefit its derivatives positions, including positions involving cash-settled options on
interest rate swaps.

CFTCâs Enforcement Director Comments

James McDonald, CFTC Director of Enforcement, commented: âThis action reflects the CFTCâs continued and vigilant
commitment to protect those who rely on the integrity of critical financial benchmarks. There is no room in our markets
for manipulationâwe will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.â

During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time with the
capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S. based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking firm
(âSwaps Brokerâ).

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily and are meant to indicate the prevailing mid-market rate, at a specific
time of day, for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. They are issued in several currencies and
are published for various maturities of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The most widely used USD ISDAFIX rates and
spreads, and the ones at issue in this Order, are those that are intended to indicate the prevailing market rate as of
11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The 11:00 a.m. USD ISDAFIX rate is used for the cash settlement of options on interest rate
swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for certain other interest rate products.

The Order finds that certain DBSI options and/or swaps traders understood and employed two primary means in their
attempts to manipulate USD ISDAFIX rates: trading attempted manipulation and submission attempted manipulation.

Trading Attempted Manipulation

According to the Order, DBSI attempted to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX by bidding, offering, and executing transactions
in targeted interest rate products, including swap spreads and U.S. Treasuries at or near the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing
time to affect rates on the electronic interest rate swap screen known as the â19901 screenâ and thereby increase or
decrease the Swaps Brokerâs reference rates and influence the final published USD ISDAFIX. As evidenced in recorded
calls and electronic communications, DBSI traders talked about âpushingâ or âmovingâ the fix, or âgetting the printâ ata
price, to benefit DBSIâs positions.

In order to effect these goalsâthrough communications involving multiple DBSI traders, on more than one DBSI trading
desk, spanning several yearsâDBSI Swap traders would tell the Swaps Broker their need for a certain swap level at 11:00
a.m. or their need to have the level moved up or down. On at least one occasion, the Swaps Broker expressed the need
to know how much âammoâ certain DBSI traders had to use in order to move the screen at 11:00 a.m.

On February 28, 2007, for example, the Swaps Broker told a DBSI Swaps trader: âI had to do what | had to do to keep âem
down, right...We got the print...50 is not going to hold it.â As this conversation demonstrates, the Swaps Broker fully
understood that the DBSI trader wanted to keep the price down and get the print that would benefit DBSIâs position.

DBSI Traders Knew Their Conduct Was Illegal

The Order finds, further, that DBSI traders knew their conduct in attempting to manipulate the USD ISDAFIX was illegal.
On one occasion, when a DBSI Swaps trader stated to a broker, âI really have no desire to ever trade equities. Itâs just a
field day for the feds,â the broker responded: âthis will be over soon as well and if they ever figured out exactly how
pricing happened through [the Swaps Broker] on a daily basis a lot of people would actually do jail time.â

Submission Attempted Manipulation

The Order also finds that on certain days in which DBSI had a trading position settling or resetting against the USD
ISDAFIX, certain DBSI Swaps Desk employees responsible for making USD ISDAFIX submissions (the âSubmitterâ or
âSubmittersâ) attempted to manipulate the final published USD ISDAFIX rates by submitting rates that were false,
misleading, or knowingly inaccurate because they purported to reflect DBSIâs honest view of the true costs of entering
into an interest rate swap in particular tenors, but in fact reflected tradersâ desire to move USD ISDAFIX higher or lower in
order to benefit DBSIâs positions. Submitters made false submissions for DBSI by skewing the rates and spreads
submitted to the Swaps Broker in the direction that could have moved the USD ISDAFIX setting to benefit DBSIâs trading
positions.
DBSI memorialized its manipulative submissions conduct in a Swap Desk Guide, authored by a Submitter, which stated
that: âSwap dealer desks submit 11 a.m. levels of rate and spreads for option striking purposes. The options desk may
ask for specific levels.â The then-Head of the Swaps Desk at DBS! understood that if an Options trader asked the Swaps
Desk for specific levels and the Submitter complied with that request, that would be wrong because that would be âfixing
the rate.â

* OK K K K XK

DBSI has taken specified steps to implement and strengthen its internal controls and procedures relating to the fixing of
interest-rate swaps benchmarks, including measures to detect and deter trading or other conduct potentially intended to
manipulate directly or indirectly swap rates, including benchmarks based on interest-rate swaps and to ensure the
integrity of the fixing of any interest-rate swap benchmark.

In the Order, the Commission advised that, under the circumstances, disqualification from making certain offerings
should not arise under Rule 262(a) of Regulation A and Rule 506(d)(1) of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), 17 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 230.262(a), 230.506(d)(1) (2017), as a consequence of the Order. In offering this advice,
the Commission considered factors similar to those used by the SEC when it considers waivers of disqualification under
Regulation A and Regulation D, as well as the previous waivers granted by the CFTC and the SEC in prior CFTC actions.
Finally, the Commission's advice is consistent with the guidance provided by the SEC in connection with its issuance of
Rule 506, which states that the provision âunder which disqualification does not apply if the regulator issuing the relevant
order determines that Rule 506 disqualification is not necessary under the circumstances, strikes an appropriate
balance,â because â[i]t allows the relevant authorities to determine the impact of their orders and conserves [SEC]
Commission resources (which might otherwise be devoted to consideration of waiver applications) in cases where the
relevant authority determines that disqualification from Rule 506 offerings is not warranted.â Disqualification of Felons
and Other âBad Actorsâ From Rule 506 Offerings, 78 FR 44730, 44748 (July 24, 2013, effective Sept. 23, 2013). The CFTC
is committed to working together with the SEC on these issues of mutual concern.

In accepting the Bankâs offer, the Commission recognizes DBSIâs cooperation with the Division of Enforcementâs
investigation in this matter. The Commission recognizes that DBSI provided important information to the Division that
helped the Division undertake its investigation efficiently and effectively. The Commission also recognizes that DBSI
commenced significant remedial action to strengthen the internal controls and policies relating to all benchmarks,
including ISDAFIX.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark, New Jersey,
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in this matter.

The following staff members assisted in this case: Candice Aloisi, Jason Fairbanks, Jordon Grimm, David MacGregor, Mark
A. Picard, David C. Newman, K. Brent Tomer and James Wheaton.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Janine M. Gargiulo, Trevor Kokal, Steven I.

CFTC Orders CHS, Inc. to Pay $500,000 Penalty for Reporting Violations

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today that an order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against CHS, Inc. a cooperative corporation headquartered in Minnesota, for failing to
submit accurate monthly CFTC Form 204 Reports regarding the composition of CHSâs fixed price cash corn and soybean
purchases and sales. The order was entered on Monday, September 30, 2019. The order also charges CHS for violating
the cease and desist provision of a 2016 CFTC order [See Release No. 7337-16], which involved a 13-year failure to file
correct Form 204 reports with the Commission.

The order entered today imposes a $500,000 civil monetary penalty and recognizes that CHSâs self-reporting,
cooperation, and remediation substantially reduced its penalty.

âThis resolution reflects the fact that entities that violate prior orders will be held accountable, but also that self-reporting
and full cooperation carry real and substantial benefits,â said CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald. âWe
acknowledge that CHS itself discovered the reporting errors and promptly self-reported the issue to the Commission,
even as CHS continued to investigate the scope of the potential violations. The reporting errors in this case were likely
not of the type that the Commission would have detected otherwise. The civil monetary penalty reflects this self-report
and substantial cooperation.â

In March 2016, the CFTC entered an order which found that CHS had violated Regulation 19.01 by failing to submit
correct Form 204 reports for a thirteen-year period. The Commission ordered CHS to pay a $1 million civil monetary
penalty, and required CHS to cease and desist from violating Regulation 19.01.

The order entered today finds that subsequent to the entry of the 2016 order, CHS continued to experience difficulty
submitting correct Form 204 Reports. These difficulties stemmed in part from a number of steps CHS took to replace its
enterprise software, which, among other things, would automate the Form 204 Report process. Following the 2016 order,
CHS began auditing the various inputs into the reports for compliance. These inputs came from, among other things,
certain of CHSâs divisions and subsidiaries.

According to the order entered today, in May 2018, CHS self-reported the Form 204 Report errors it was aware of to the
Commission. Subsequently, CHS continued auditing its Form 204 Reports and apprised the Commission when it
discovered new information. CHS accepted responsibility for its failures, was forthcoming and responsive in connection
with questions regarding the violations and remediation, and performed an analysis to determine if any position limits
violations had occurred as a result of the erroneous Form 204 Reports.

Consistent with this filing, the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight issued in 2013 an advisory regarding the obligation of
market participants to submit accurate Form 204 Reports. [See CFTC Staff Advisory No. 13-42]

The Division of Enforcement thanks the Division of Market Oversight for their assistance in this matter.

CFTC Orders Connecticut-Based Tillage Commodities, LLC to Pay a $150,000 Civil
Monetary Penalty for Supervision Failures

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against Connecticut-based Tillage Commodities, LLC (Tillage), a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO), for
failure to supervise its fund administratorâs operation of the commodity poolâs bank account containing pool participantsâ
funds. Tillage has been registered as a CPO with the CFTC since 2013, with its principal office located in Stamford,
Connecticut.

The CFTC Order requires Tillage to pay a $150,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease and desist from further violations
of the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged.

Specifically, the Order finds that over the course of 21 days, from at least March 3, 2016 through March 24, 2016,
Tillageâs fund administrator received seven fraudulent requests to transfer funds from the commodity poolâs bank
account. These unauthorized transfers to two purported private technology companies in Hong Kong ranged in amount
from $200,000 to $3 million. These requests were made by an unknown party who spoofed Tillageâs managing memberâs
email address and sent requests that imitated, in some respects, Tillageâs typical transfer requests, the Order finds.
Tillageâs fund administrator processed five of these requests, which resulted in a $5.9 million loss of pool participantsâ
funds, or 64% of the poolâs total capital, according to the Order.

Although only the fund administrator had the right to make withdrawals from the pool bank account, Tillage had no
procedures in place to monitor the administratorâs operation of this account and no system in place to alert it when
transactions cleared from the account, the Order states.

During the period when the fraud occurred, the Order finds that Tillage only reviewed the pool bank accountâs balance
once during the month to verify its calculation of the poolâs net asset value. Furthermore, while Tillage could review the
activity in the account on the bankâs website, from January 7, 2016 to March 24, 2016, Tillage failed to do so.

The inadequacy of Tillageâs supervision of its agent regarding wire transfers and the operation of the poolâs bank
account, and the insufficiency of Tillageâs policies and systems, delayed detection of the ongoing fraud, the Order finds.

The CFTC thanks the National Futures Association for its assistance in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Lucy C. Hynes, Kyong J. Koh, Traci L. Rodriguez
and Paul G. Hayeck.

CFTC Orders Commodity Pool Operator, CEO to Pay More Than $10 Million for Misleading
Statements, Supervision Failures

Portfolio Manager Charged with Fraud

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against Catalyst Capital Advisors LLC, of Huntington, New York, and its CEO, Jerry Szilagyi, for
materially misleading statements made by Catalyst and one of its portfolio managers, and for failing to implement an
adequate supervisory system to prevent such misstatements. Separately, the CFTC charged the portfolio manager,
Edward Walczak, of Madison, Wisconsin, with fraud in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District
of Wisconsin.

The order requires Catalyst, a registered commodity pool operator, to pay a $1.3 million civil monetary penalty and
$8,908,481 in disgorgement (including pre-judgment interest). The order also requires Szilagyi to pay a $300,000 civil
monetary penalty. Catalyst and Szilagyi are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.

âWe are committed to protecting investorsâincluding those who invest in our markets through mutual funds,â said CFTC
Director of Enforcement James McDonald. âAs this case shows, when companies or individuals make misleading
statements about the risks of investing in their productsâstatements that go to the heart of any investment decisionâ
they will be held accountable.â

Joshua Sterling, Director of the CFTC Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, added: âThe Commissionâs
disclosure requirements are a critical component of ensuring that commodity pool investors have the full protections
afforded to them and for promoting the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of our markets. We will continue to support
Enforcementâs efforts to ensure that commodity pool operators play by the rules.â

The order finds that Catalyst and its agents made representations regarding risk management of the Catalyst Hedged
Futures Strategy Fund (the âfundâ) that were materially misleading. Specifically, Catalyst is found liable for the
misstatements of the fundâs portfolio manager regarding his management of the Fundâs risk, as well as Catalystâs
misrepresentations that stop-loss measures were in place to limit losses, when in fact no such measures existed.
Additionally, while Catalyst represented that a dedicated risk manager monitored the fundâs risk metrics daily, the risk
manager did not actually do so. The order concludes that Catalyst failed to implement or maintain adequate procedures
to ensure that those acting on its behalf did not make misrepresentations to investors or investment advisors. Finally,
the order finds Szilagyi liable as a control person for Catalystâs violations.

In the complaint filed against Walczak, the CFTC alleges that, from at least November 2014 to February 2017, Walczak
led investors or investment advisors to believe that the fund was a safer investment than it actually was. Among other
things, the complaint alleges that that Walczak falsely told investment advisors that he took specific steps to prevent the
fund from losing more than 8 percent of its value. The complaint alleges that Walczak routinely failed to hedge in the
manner he said he did, ultimately resulting in at least $500,000,000 of investor losses.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today also issued an order filing and settling similar charges against
Catalyst and Szilagyi, and filed a complaint against Walczak in federal court. Per the terms of the CFTC and SEC orders,
each agency will give credit for monetary sanctions paid by Catalyst and/or Szilagyi to the other. Moreover, per the
terms of the SEC order, a Fair Fund will be established for the benefit of affected investors.

In its continuing civil litigation against Walczak, the CFTC seeks, among other relief, disgorgement of benefits from
violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, restitution, civil monetary penalties, registration bans, and permanent
injunctions against future violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation and assistance of the SEC in this matter.

",Release Number 8109-20,"January 27, 2020","CFTC Orders Commodity Pool Operator, CEO to Pay More Than $10 Million for Misleading. Statements, Supervision Failures. Portfolio Manager Charged with Fraud.","Washington, D.C. — The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and simultaneously settling charges against Catalyst Capital Advisors LLC, of Huntington, New York, and its CEO, Jerry Szilagyi, for materially misleading statements made by Catalyst and one of its portfolio managers, and for failing to implement an adequate supervisory system to prevent such misstatements. Separately, the CFTC charged the portfolio manager, Edward Walczak, of Madison, Wisconsin, with fraud in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.

The order requires Catalyst, a registered commodity pool operator, to pay a $1.3 million civil monetary penalty and $8,908,481 in disgorgement (including pre-judgment interest). The order also requires Szilagyi to pay a $300,000 civil monetary penalty. Catalyst and Szilagyi are ordered to cease and desist from further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations, as charged.

“We are committed to protecting investors—including those who invest in our markets through mutual funds,” said CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald. “As this case shows, when companies or individuals make misleading statements about the risks of investing in their products—statements that go to the heart of any investment decision— they will be held accountable.”
Joshua Sterling, Director of the CFTC Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight, added: “The Commission’s disclosure requirements are a critical component of ensuring that commodity pool investors have the full protections afforded to them and for promoting the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of our markets. We will continue to support Enforcement’s efforts to ensure that commodity pool operators play by the rules.”
The order finds that Catalyst and its agents made representations regarding risk management of the Catalyst Hedged Futures Strategy Fund (the “fund”) that were materially misleading. Specifically, Catalyst is found liable for the misstatements of the fund’s portfolio manager regarding his management of the Fund’s risk, as well as Catalyst’s misrepresentations that stop-loss measures were in place to limit losses, when in fact no such measures existed.
 Additionally, while Catalyst represented that a dedicated risk manager monitored the fund’s risk metrics daily, the risk manager did not actually do so. The order concludes that Catalyst failed to implement or maintain adequate procedures to ensure that those acting on its behalf did not make misrepresentations to investors or investment advisors. Finally, the order finds Szilagyi liable as a control person for Catalyst’s violations.

In the complaint filed against Walczak, the CFTC alleges that, from at least November 2014 to February 2017, Walczak led investors or investment advisors to believe that the fund was a safer investment than it actually was. Among other things, the complaint alleges that that Walczak falsely told investment advisors that he took specific steps to prevent the fund from losing more than 8 percent of its value.

Federal Court Orders More than $1 Million in Restitution and Civil Monetary Penalties and
Permanently Bans Andrew Kurzbard and His Florida-Based Company, Guardian Asset
Group, LLC, for Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Kenneth A.
Marra of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a Consent Order against Guardian Asset
Group, LLC (Guardian) of West Palm Beach, Florida, and its owner and principal, Andrew Kurzbard, with a last-known
address in Hacksneck, Virginia, finding that Guardian and Kurzbard engaged in illegal, off-exchange transactions in
precious metals with retail customers on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis.

The Order requires Guardian and Kurzbard, jointly and severally, to pay restitution of $434,413.54 and a $651,620.31
civil monetary penalty. The Order also imposes permanent trading and registration bans against Guardian and Kurzbard
and prohibits them from further violating the Commodity Exchange Act, as charged. The Order stems from a CFTC civil
enforcement action filed against Guardian and Kurzbard on September 30, 2015, charging them with engaging in illegal,
off-exchange precious metals transactions (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7257-15).

Courtâs Order Finds that Guardianâs Customers Paid It at Least $1.7 Million for Precious Metals
Transactions, Including over $434,000 in Commissions and Fees

According to the Order, from February 2012 through at least February 2013, Guardian, by and through its employees,
including Kurzbard, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in leveraged, margined, or financed precious
metals transactions. During that period, Guardianâs customers paid at least $1.7 million to Guardian in connection with
precious metals transactions, and Guardian received commissions and fees totaling at least $434,413.54. The Order also
finds that Guardian accepted customer orders and funds and therefore acted as a Futures Commission Merchant without
registering as such with the CFTC.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, leveraged, margined, or financed
transactions, such as those conducted by Guardian, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual
delivery of metals within 28 days. The Order finds that metals were never actually delivered in connection with the
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions made on behalf of Guardianâs customers.

The Order further finds that Guardian executed the illegal precious metals transactions through AmeriFirst
Management, LLC (AmeriFirst). The CFTC filed an enforcement action against AmeriFirst in July 2013, charging it and
other defendants with engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions, and charging AmeriFirst with fraud
and other violations (see CFTC Press Release 6655-13, July 30, 2013).

On September 17, 2013, the Court entered a Consent Order resolving the CFTCâs claims against AmeriFirst, finding it
liable for illegal off-exchange precious metals transactions and fraud (see CFTC Press Release 6973-14, August 7, 2014).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are James Humphrey, Elsie Robinson, Stephen
Turley, Thomas Simek, Peter Riggs, and Charles Marvine.

CFTC Orders Chicago Trading Firm and Its Co-Founder to Pay $2.5 Million in Penalties for
Spoofing and Manipulative Trading Scheme

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today the filing and settling of
enforcement actions against Hard Eight Futures, LLC and Igor Chernomzav for spoofing - bidding or offering with
the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution - and for engaging in a manipulative and deceptive trading
scheme. Hard Eight is a proprietary trading firm located in Chicago, Illinois. Chernomzav is a founder, partner of, and
trader for, Hard Eight, and resides in Monsey, New York.

âThis case is about maintaining fair markets,â said CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald. âMarket integrity in
todayâs electronically traded markets starts with making sure bids and offers represent real buying and selling interest,
not fake order flow intended to manipulate other market participants.â

The orders require Hard Eight and Chernomzav to pay civil monetary penalties of $1.75 million and $750,000,
respectively, for total penalties of $2.5 million. In addition, Chernomzav is barred from trading in any market regulated
by the CFTC for a period of nine months.

The orders state that from March 2014 through March 2015, Chernomzav placed bids and offers for E-mini futures
contracts on Globex, the CMEâs electronic trading platform, with the intent to cancel those orders before execution. At
the time Chernomzav placed and cancelled the orders, they constituted a substantial percentage of the best bid or offer.

The CFTC orders find that Chernomzav placed the orders to create a false impression of significant buying or selling
interest. Chernomzav used this false impression of buying or selling interest, or the sudden and dramatic removal
thereof, to induce other market participants to transact with orders that he wanted to be executed at prices or in
quantities favorable to him.

Chernomzav engaged in this conduct on more than a thousand occasions between March 2014 and March 2015.

The CME Groupâs Market Regulation Department independently conducted a parallel investigation, and today also
announced disciplinary actions against Hard Eight and Chernomzav. The CFTC thanks CME Group for its assistance in
this matter.

The CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Ashley J. Burden, Joy McCormack, Matthew
Edelstein, David Terrell, and Scott Williamson.

CFTC Sues Forex Dealer for Registration and Disclosure Violations

JAFX, Ltd. Solicits U.S. Retail Customers to Trade Forex without Registering as a Retail
Foreign Exchange Dealer

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Utah against JAFX, Ltd. (JAFX), a/k/a JAFX, EOOD, of Sofia, Bulgaria and Kingstown, St.
Vincent and the Grenadines. The CFTC Complaint alleges that, from at least September 2016 and continuing to the

and that it fails to provide customers with the required Risk Disclosure Statement.

Specifically, the CFTCâs Complaint, filed on July 27, 2018, charges that JAFX has been the counterparty to leveraged,
retail forex transactions for customers located in the United States, who are not Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs).
JAFX allegedly solicits orders from U.S. customers who are not ECPs to open leveraged, retail forex trading accounts
through JAFXâs website, as well as videos on YouTube, where JAFX is, or offers to be, the counterparty to each leveraged
retail forex transaction. Customers are directed to open trading accounts by submitting an online account application
through JAFXâs website, and JAFX encourages customers to access and trade their accounts via a mobile application,
according to the Complaint. U.S. customers allegedly may open an account with JAFX for as little as $100.

CFTC Participates in Operation Income Illusion to Raise Retail Fraud Awareness

December 14, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced its participation in âOperation
Income Illusion.â Soearheaded by the Federal Trade Commission, Operation Income Illusion is a joint effort announcing
law enforcement cases and customer education information as part of a nationwide crackdown on scams targeting
customers with fake promises of income.

The Operation Income Illusion initiative encompasses cases from 20 federal, state, and local agencies, including 32
actions from the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement. The CFTCâs participation in the initiative underscores the Commission's
commitment to protecting customers in derivatives markets.

âThe CFTCâs enforcement efforts in connection with Operation Income Illusion demonstrate that the CFTC continues to
bring critical, high impact cases that protect customers. We can most effectively protect customers by working together
with our colleagues in the enforcement and regulatory community,â said Division of Enforcement Acting Director Vince
McGonagle. âPartnership with our counterparts is an indispensable element of our enforcement program.â

In addition to the CFTCâs Operation Income Illusion enforcement cases, it is raising awareness about the potential for
fraud through its social media accounts. In recent months, the CFTC has received hundreds of tips about individuals
posing as digital asset or foreign exchange brokers promising to multiply investments tens or hundreds of times in a
matter of weeks. The promises, most often times made by unregistered entities, are used to get traders to invest and
pay one fee after another in order to claim their profits. These frauds generally originate on social media platforms and
utilize other technologies, such as encrypted messaging apps, that further hide the fraudstersâ true identities. The CFTC
posts highlight recent fraud trends and provide tips to help social media users spot and avoid potential scams.

âAll of the CFTC cases included in Operation Income Illusion have one thing in common,â said Director of the Market
Participants Division Joshua B. Sterling, whose unit oversees the CFTCâs customer education initiatives. âNone of the
entities or perpetrators that committed these frauds were registered with the CFTC. Registration is not a guarantee of
fraud-free trading, but it does provide certain safeguards that can weed out bad actors and ensures customers receive all
the protections afforded to them under the law. All market participants, whether they are seasoned hedgers or freshly
minted speculators, should check the registration status of the people and companies they give their money to before
trading.â

CFTCâs Customer Protection Information

The CFTC has issued advisories, videos, and publications to alert customers about fraud and easy ways to spot them.

 

Customers can report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the

CFTC Charges Michigan Resident Jerry Stauffer with Commodity Pool Fraud and Other
Violations

Federal Court Issues Emergency Order Freezing Staufferâs Assets and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Chief Judge Paul L.
Maloney, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan issued an emergency Order freezing and
preserving the remaining pool participant assets under the control of Defendant Jerry Stauffer of Traverse City,
Michigan. The Order, entered under seal on February 25, 2015, also prohibits Stauffer from destroying books and records
and grants the CFTC immediate access to those records.

The Order arises out of a civil enforcement Complaint filed under seal by the CFTC on the same date, charging Stauffer
with fraudulently soliciting at least $968,000 from members of the public to trade foreign exchange (forex) ina
commodity pool, by among other things, guaranteeing pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on
profits purportedly earned from forex trading. The CFTC Complaint further alleges that Stauffer prepared and distributed
to pool participants false account statements showing huge profits, while at the same time he traded very little forex and
diverted pool participantsâ funds for his own use. In addition to fraud, the Complaint alleges that Stauffer illegally
operated a commodity pool.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten
gains, the payment of appropriate monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent
injunction from future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Western District of
Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

CFTC Division Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Eugenia Vroustouris, Michelle Bougas, Kathy
Banar, Erica Bodin, and Rick Glaser.

The Order, entered under seal on February 25, 2015, also prohibits Stauffer from destroying books and records and grants the CFTC immediate access to those records.

The Order arises out of a civil enforcement Complaint filed under seal by the CFTC on the same date, charging Stauffer with fraudulently soliciting at least $968,000 from members of the public to trade foreign exchange (forex) ina commodity pool, by among other things, guaranteeing pool participants a monthly return on their investment based on profits purportedly earned from forex trading. The CFTC Complaint further alleges that Stauffer prepared and distributed to pool participants false account statements showing huge profits, while at the same time he traded very little forex and diverted pool participants’ funds for his own use. In addition to fraud, the Complaint alleges that Stauffer illegally operated a commodity pool.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded pool participants, disgorgement of any ill-gotten gains, the payment of appropriate monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the cooperation of the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

Federal Court Orders North Carolina Resident James Harvey Mason to Pay a Civil Penalty
and Restitution Totaling $5.5 Million for Commodity Pool Fraud

In a related criminal action involving the same conduct, Mason pleaded
guilty in June 2014 and is awaiting sentencing

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge C. Graham
Mullen of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a Consent Order against Defendant
James Harvey Mason of Graham, North Carolina, imposing a $1.67 million civil monetary penalty and restitution of
$3.88 million in connection with off-exchange foreign currency (forex) commodity pool fraud in violation of the
Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The Consent Order also permanently enjoins Mason from further violations of the CEA,
as charged, and imposes permanent trading and registration bans on him. Mason has never been registered with the
CFTC in any capacity.

The Court Order arises out of the CFTC enforcement Complaint filed on March 27, 2013 (see CFTC Complaint and Press
Release 6549-13). The Consent Order finds that, commencing in at least July 2010, Mason fraudulently solicited,
accepted, and pooled at least $5.3 million from approximately 500 participants. The Consent Order further finds that
Mason pooled only a portion of the participant funds and placed them in forex trading accounts in his commodity poolsâ
names, in which he lost over $1.12 million trading and that he deposited the rest of the participant funds in various bank
accounts, withdrawing funds as needed to make âPonziâ payments to other participants, and misappropriating at least
$779,000 of participant funds and using such funds for purposes other than for forex trading.

Related Criminal Action

In a criminal action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina involving the same conduct, Mason
pleaded guilty in June 2014 to single counts of securities fraud conspiracy and filing a false tax return for tax year 2011,
and is awaiting sentencing (see U.S. v. james Harvey Mason, No. 3:14-cr-122-FDW).

The CFTC cautions victims that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers
may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to
ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the North Carolina Secretary of State Securities Division and the U.S. Attorneyâs
Office for the Western District of North Carolina in this matter.

Federal Court Finds Former Precious Metals CEO Robert Escobio in Contempt of Court for
Failure to Pay Restitution to Defrauded Customers

Escobio Ordered to Surrender to United States Marshal Service

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that on March 18, 2019,
District Judge James Lawrence King of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered an order finding
Coral Gables, Florida resident Robert Escobio in contempt (âContempt Orderâ) for failing to pay more than $1.5 million
in previously-ordered restitution to defrauded customers of Mr. Escobioâs now-defunct precious metals firm, Southern
Trust Metals, Inc. (âSouthern Trustâ).

The Contempt Order, entered after a two-day evidentiary hearing, required Mr. Escobio to pay $350,000 in restitution
within ten days, plus an additional $10,000 per month until Escobioâs restitution obligation has been satisfied. Mr.
Escobio failed to make the $350,000 payment and has been ordered to surrender to the U.S. Marshall Service for
incarceration until he has fully complied.

James McDonald, Director of the CFTCâs Division of Enforcement said: âInvestor protection and market integrity are two
core components of the CFTCâs mission. We will not allow defendants with apparent means to pay, like Mr. Escobio, to
shirk their restitution obligations at the expense of defrauded customers.â

The Contempt Order stems from an enforcement action filed by the Commission against Mr. Escobio and Southern Trust
in 2014 (CFIC Press No. 6969-14). After trial on the merits, Judge King found that Mr. Escobio had masterminded a
scheme to defraud customers relating to the purported sale of precious metals through Southern Trust. On September 1,
2017, Judge King ordered, among other things, for Escobio to pay restitution in the amount of $1,543,892 to compensate
victims of the Southern Trustâs leveraged precious metals scheme (âRestitution Orderâ). The United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit subsequently denied Mr. Escobioâs appeal of the Restitution Order on July 12, 2018.

After a two-day evidentiary hearing on whether Mr. Escobio should be found in contempt, Judge King found as follows:

The evidence shows that Escobio has more than $900,000 in assets, and that since the judgment he has benefitted from
a household income of around $250,000 a year, plus the $200,000 to $300,000 in purported âloans.â In light of these
facts, Escobioâs payments totaling $3,525 do not constitute good faith compliance with the final judgment. Not only that,
the evidence shows that Escobio does not intend to comply with the Courtâs restitution order and has deliberately and
contemptuously refused to do so.

Mr. Escobio has appealed the Contempt Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Ashley J. Burden, Carlin Metzger, Heather
Dasso, Venice Bickham, Joseph Konizeski, Scott Williamson and former staff member Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Orders Toronto-Based Firm to Pay $500,000 for Violating Capital, Reporting, and
Supervision Rules

August 21, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued an order filing and settling charges
against OANDA Corporation, a futures commission merchant (FCM) and retail foreign exchange dealer (RFED)
headquartered in Toronto, Canada, for violating certain capital, reporting, and supervision rules.

Specifically, OANDA failed to meet minimum net capital requirements, violated the equity withdrawal restriction in
making dividend payments on three occasions, failed to meet certain reporting requirements, and failed to diligently
supervise matters related to its business as a CFTC registrant. The order requires OANDA to pay a $500,000 civil
monetary penalty and to cease and desist from any further violations of CFTC regulations, as charged.

âThe CFTCâs capital, reporting, and supervision requirements are critical to ensuring market integrity and the protection
of customers,â said Division of Enforcement Director James McDonald. âWe will continue to be diligent in holding firms
accountable for violating these regulations.â

âCapital requirements are a cornerstone of the regulatory framework governing CFTC-regulated intermediaries and we
will continue to monitor firms for compliance with these important rules,â added Division of Swap Dealer and
Intermediary Oversight Director Joshua B. Sterling. âWe look forward to continuing to work with the Division of
Enforcement when firms fall short of their financial obligations.â

Case Background

The order finds that, in or around October 2018 and during the period April 2019 to August 2019, OANDA failed at times
to meet certain capital requirements applicable to FCMs offering or engaging in retail foreign currency transactions
and/or to RFEDs. OANDA failed to meet net capital requirements from April 26, 2019 to August 21, 2019 and made
dividend payments on October 15, 2018, April 26, 2019, and May 28, 2019 in violation of the equity withdrawal
restriction. Additionally, OANDA failed to meet certain financial reporting requirements related to these violations. The
order also finds that OANDA did not maintain adequate internal controls with respect to these financial and reporting
requirements. Consequently, the firm failed to diligently supervise matters related to its business as a CFTC registrant.

The order recognizes OANDAâs cooperation in the investigation of this matter. The order also notes that the Division of
Enforcement found no indication that customers suffered losses as a result of the firmâs net capital and equity withdrawal
restriction violations.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the National Futures Association for their assistance. Kelly Venezia, Robert Loeber,
and Gerald J. Nudge of the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight also assisted with this matter.

CFTC Charges Florida-Based Mark Olsen Mining Company and Betty Lea Grimes with
Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil enforcement action charging
Florida-based Defendants Mark Olsen Mining Company (MOMC) and Betty Lea Grimes with engaging in illegal, off-
exchange transactions in precious metals with retail customers on both a fully paid as well as a leveraged, margined, or
financed basis. Grimes is MOMCâs president, controlling person, and managing member. Grimes has used the following
names, and/or combinations of these names, in various legal documents: Betty Grimes, Lea Grimes, Lea Lauren, Betty
Nehme, and Lea Nehme. Neither MOMC nor Grimes has ever been registered with the CFTC.

The CFTC Complaint, filed in in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, further alleges that Grimes, as
controlling person for MOMC, is liable for MOMCâs violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA).

According to the Complaint, from at least April 2013 and continuing through at least February 2014, MOMC, by and
through its employees, including Grimes, solicited retail customers by telephone to engage in fully paid as well as
leveraged, margined, or financed precious metals transactions. During that period, MOMC collected more than $870,000
from three customers for the purported purpose of investing in precious metals. Instead, as alleged, MOMC customers
never received precious metals, and the Defendants misappropriated all MOMC customer funds. The Defendants used
the misappropriated funds to pay for Grimesâ personal expenses, with the remaining funds wire transferred to a person
purporting to be Mark Olsen in South Africa, according to the Complaint.

Defendants Made Material False and Misleading Representations and Omissions

The Defendants in their solicitations to actual and potential customers allegedly used a website and marketing materials
that contained false representations to defraud customers who wished to purchase precious metals from MOMC. Also,
the Defendants allegedly made additional misrepresentations in direct oral and written communications with customers.

In its continuing litigation against the Defendants, the CFTC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary
penalties, restitution, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction from future violations of the
CEA, as charged.

This is not Grimesâ first violation of the CEA. In 2007, using the fictitious name Lea Lauren, Grimes signed a Consent
Order with the CFTC. CFIC v. Madison Forex LLC, No. 05-61672 (S.D. Fla. July 16, 2007). The Consent Order found that
Defendants fraudulently solicited more than $4.5 million from customers, in connection with the trading of forex options.
As a salesperson for one of the Defendants, Grimes was similarly charged with making false statements and omissions.
(See CFTC Press Releases 5134-05 and 5379-07.)

CFTC Charges Brooklyn Resident Yehuda L. Belsky with Binary Options Fraud, Violating a
Prior CFTC Order and Making False Statements to the CFTC

CFTC also Charges Belsky with Acting as an Unregistered Commodity Trading Advisor

Washington DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) filed a civil enforcement action
in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charging Yehuda L. Belsky of Brooklyn, New York, and his
firm Y Trading, LLC (Y Trading) with solicitation fraud in connection with binary options trading. The CFTC Complaint
also charges Belsky with making false statements to the CFTC about his binary options trading and failing to register with
the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Advisor, as required. According to the Complaint, Belsky solicited at least $1,258,000
from at least 14 customers to purportedly trade binary options on their behalf.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Comments

James McDonald, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement, commented: âThe enforcement action filed today demonstrates
the Commissionâs continued commitment to root out fraud in our markets. Todayâs action also makes clear that the
Commission will prosecute violations of its prior orders and those who provide false statements to the Commission. In
our efforts to police our markets, we will continue to work closely and in parallel with our law enforcement partners to
protect the public and to ensure that bad actors are held accountable.â Mr. McDonald specifically thanked the U.S.
Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and his colleagues for their work in that officeâs parallel criminal proceeding,
which was also filed today.

The CFTCâs Complaint alleges that from at least June 22, 2015, through the present, Belsky, individually and on behalf of
Y Trading, fraudulently solicited customers by making materially false statements, including that he was an expert binary
options trader with a record of profitable binary options trading on behalf of multiple customers. At the same time,
Belsky allegedly failed to disclose that he was misappropriating customer funds, had no binary options trading account in
the name of Y Trading or in his own name from which to trade and had been the subject of a 2008 CFTC Order. Belsky,
as alleged, also deceived some customers by providing a false binary options trading account statement and by using the
fictitious name of âJay Bellâ to conceal his identity.

Violation of 2008 CFTC Order

The 2008 CFTC Order found that Belsky and a company he previously owned, Innovative Capital Management, LLC
(Innovative), had committed a $1,250,000 fraud, furnished false documents to the National Futures Association, and
misappropriated pool participantsâ funds. The 2008 CFTC Order, among other things, imposed permanent trading bans
on Belsky and Innovative, including a permanent prohibition from trading on any registered entities (see CFTC Press
Release and Order, 5589-08, December 19, 2008).

As alleged, Belsky violated the 2008 CFTC Order by acquiring log-in credentials from at least three of his customers and
surreptitiously trading their binary options accounts held on a registered exchange.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil
monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of
federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.

",Release Number 7802-18,"September 26, 2018","CFTC Charges Brooklyn Resident Yehuda L. Belsky with Binary Options Fraud, Violating a. Prior CFTC Order and Making False Statements to the CFTC. CFTC also Charges Belsky with Acting as an Unregistered Commodity Trading Advisor.","Washington DC — The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC or Commission) filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, charging Yehuda L. Belsky of Brooklyn, New York, and his firm Y Trading, LLC (Y Trading) with solicitation fraud in connection with binary options trading. The CFTC Complaint also charges Belsky with making false statements to the CFTC about his binary options trading and failing to register with the CFTC as a Commodity Trading Advisor, as required. According to the Complaint, Belsky solicited at least $1,258,000 from at least 14 customers to purportedly trade binary options on their behalf.

CFTC Director of Enforcement Comments
James McDonald, the CFTC’s Director of Enforcement, commented: “The enforcement action filed today demonstrates the Commission’s continued commitment to root out fraud in our markets. Today’s action also makes clear that the Commission will prosecute violations of its prior orders and those who provide false statements to the Commission. In our efforts to police our markets, we will continue to work closely and in parallel with our law enforcement partners to protect the public and to ensure that bad actors are held accountable.” Mr. McDonald specifically thanked the U.S.
 Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and his colleagues for their work in that office’s parallel criminal proceeding, which was also filed today.

The CFTC’s Complaint alleges that from at least June 22, 2015, through the present, Belsky, individually and on behalf of Y Trading, fraudulently solicited customers by making materially false statements, including that he was an expert binary options trader with a record of profitable binary options trading on behalf of multiple customers. At the same time, Belsky allegedly failed to disclose that he was misappropriating customer funds, had no binary options trading account in the name of Y Trading or in his own name from which to trade and had been the subject of a 2008 CFTC Order. Belsky, as alleged, also deceived some customers by providing a false binary options trading account statement and by using the fictitious name of “Jay Bell” to conceal his identity.

Violation of 2008 CFTC Order
The 2008 CFTC Order found that Belsky and a company he previously owned, Innovative Capital Management, LLC (Innovative), had committed a $1,250,000 fraud, furnished false documents to the National Futures Association, and misappropriated pool participants’ funds. The 2008 CFTC Order, among other things, imposed permanent trading bans on Belsky and Innovative, including a permanent prohibition from trading on any registered entities (see CFTC Press Release and Order, 5589-08, December 19, 2008).

As alleged, Belsky violated the 2008 CFTC Order by acquiring log-in credentials from at least three of his customers and surreptitiously trading their binary options accounts held on a registered exchange.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks full restitution to defrauded customers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil monetary penalties, permanent registration and trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of federal commodities laws, as charged.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.","CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Thomas Kelly, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Danielle Karst, Hillary Van Tassel, Anthony Homer, John Einstman, Richard Foelber, and Paul G.

CFTC Orders The Bank of Nova Scotia to Pay $127.4 Million for Spoofing, False
Statements, Compliance and Supervision Violations

Record Civil Monetary Penalties Levied for Spoofing, False Statements, and Swap Dealer
Compliance and Supervision Violations

August 19, 2020

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today issued three orders filing and settling charges
against The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), a provisionally registered swap dealer, resolving two separate enforcement
actions. The combined orders require BNS to pay $127.4 million for spoofing and making false statements [See CFTC
Press Release No. 8221-20], as well as for swap dealer compliance and supervision violations and additional false
statements. [See CFTC Press Release No. 8222-20]

âThese record-setting penalties reflect not only our commitment to being tough on those who break the rules, but also
the tremendous strides the agency has made in data analytics. Our ability to go through the electronic order book and
look across markets has enabled the CFTC to not only spot misconduct, but also to uncover false and misleading
statements,â said CFTC Chairman Heath P. Tarbert. âOver the last year, we have ushered in a new era of enforcement at
the CFTC. Wrongdoers now have increasingly fewer ways to conceal their misconduct and face an even more unified
front from civil and criminal authorities.â

âEntities seeking to cooperate with the CFTC, like all others that interact with the Commission, must tell the truth,â added
Division of Enforcement Director James McDonald. âWe now have the tools, including through the development of our
data-analytics program, to better test and verify the information we receive. When entities are not completely truthful,
they will be penalized.â

âBNSâs compliance and supervision violations highlight the need for all swap dealers to have the right tone at the topâ
plus appropriate programs and incentives in placeâto instill a meaningful culture of compliance among their personnel,â
added Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight Director Joshua B. Sterling. âThe CFTC will continue to apply
rigorous oversight to all registrants, and firms will be referred to enforcement whenever there is a strong indication that
our rules may have been broken.â

Spoofing and False Statements Enforcement Action

The first two orders require BNS to pay a total of $77.4 million to settle a CFTC enforcement action arising from
manipulative and deceptive conduct that spanned more than eight years and involved thousands of occasions of
attempted manipulation and spoofing in gold and silver futures contracts. BNS was originally penalized $800,000 in 2018
[See CFTC Press Release No. 7818-18] for spoofing in the gold and silver futures markets, but multiple statements the
company made to CFTC staff during the course of that investigationâon which the CFTC predicated its findings and
sanctionsâwere later proven to be false. The charges resolved today address those false statements (False Statements
Order) and the true scope and nature of BNSâs wrongdoing that those false statements concealed (Spoofing Order). This
includes a record-setting $17 million penalty for making false and misleading statements to CFTC staff during the CFTCâs
initial spoofing investigation and a record-setting penalty of $42 million for spoofing and attempted manipulation. BNS is
also required to pay $6,622,190 in restitution and $11,828,912 in disgorgement, and to retain an independent monitor.

The CFTC acknowledges and thanks the Department of Justice Fraud Sectionâs Commodities Fraud Group, the U.S.
Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
for their assistance in this matter.

This case is brought in connection with the Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force, and the staff members
responsible for this case are Jonah E. McCarthy, Jennifer Blakley, Dmitriy Vilenskiy, Hillary Van Tassel, A. Daniel Ullman Il,
and Paul G. Hayeck.

Related Criminal Action

In a parallel action, the Department of Justice announced entry of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with BNS, deferring
criminal prosecution on charges of attempted price manipulation and wire fraud. Under the agreement, BNS, among
other things, will pay $60.4 million in criminal fines, forfeiture, and restitution. The CFTCâs Spoofing Order provides for
offsets for certain payments made pursuant to the related criminal action.

See CFTC Press Release No. 8271-70 for additional details about this case.
Swap Dealer Compliance, Supervision, and False Statements Enforcement Action

The third order requires BNS to pay a $50 million civil monetary penalty to settle a separate enforcement action for swap
dealer business conduct, compliance, and supervision failures, and making false or misleading statements (Compliance
and Supervision Order). The order finds that for tens of thousands of swaps, BNS: (i) failed to provide timely and accurate
pre-trade mid-market marks, which had the effect of concealing BNSâs full markup from counterparties; (ii) violated
various requirements relating to BNSâs counterparty onboarding process, recordkeeping, chief compliance officer
reporting, and supervision; and (iii) made false or misleading statements to CFTC staff concerning its audio retention and
supervision. The order finds that these violations occurred over a seven-year period.
The order requires BNS to retain an independent monitor. As set out in the order, BNS acknowledges that the findings of
the order provide the Commission sufficient grounds to commence proceedings to suspend or revoke BNS'âs registration
status, but the Commission defers commencing such proceedings on the condition that BNS fulfills its obligations relating

to registration, remediation, and the monitor.
The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the National Futures Association. Pamela Geraghty, Andree

CFTC Charges Traders at Major U.S. Bank with Manipulating the Precious Metals Futures
Markets

Washington, DC â The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed a civil enforcement action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Michael Nowak, of New Jersey, and Gregg Smith, of New York,
charging them with spoofing, engaging in a manipulative and deceptive scheme, and attempting to manipulate prices in
the precious metals futures markets while employed at a major U.S. bank. This case was brought in connection with the
CFTC Division of Enforcementâs Spoofing Task Force.

âThese charges strike at the core of our agencyâs missionâto preserve market integrity and to protect those who
participate in our markets from fraud and manipulation. As alleged here, traders at a major financial institution sought to
profit by manipulating the precious metals futures markets. The alleged scheme involved injecting false information into
the market, through an unlawful trade practice known as spoofing, to trick others into executing the defendantsâ trades
at a price, quantity, or time that otherwise would not have been available,â said CFTC Director of Enforcement James
McDonald. âWe will continue to vigorously pursue all forms of misconduct that have the potential to undermine the
integrity of our markets.â

The CFTC complaint alleges that beginning in at least 2008 and continuing through at least 2015, while placing orders for
and trading precious metals futures contracts on CME Group Inc.âs exchanges, Nowak and Smith repeatedly engaged in
manipulative or deceptive acts and practices by spoofing (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer
before execution). The defendants placed thousands of orders with the intention to cancel them in order to send false
signals of increased buying or selling interest designed to trick market participants into executing the orders the
defendants wanted filled. The complaint also alleges that the defendants engaged in spoofing with the intent to
manipulate market prices and create artificial prices, and thereby enable their orders to be filled sooner, at a better price,
or in larger quantities than they otherwise would. According to the complaint, the defendants were aware other traders
at the bank were also spoofing, and Smith taught other traders at the bank how to spoof.

In its continuing civil litigation, the CFTC seeks, among other relief, civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, restitution,
trading bans, and a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal commodities laws, as charged.

Related Criminal Action

Earlier today, a criminal indictment brought by the Department of Justice against traders including Nowak and Smith was
unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. See United States v. Smith et al., No. 19-CR-669
(N.D.III.).

CFTC Files Enforcement Action against Chinese National Yumin Li and BVI Company
Kering Capital Ltd. for Defrauding a CME Member in an Illegal Trading Scheme

Li and Kering Capital Charged with Defrauding Liâs Employer and
Misappropriation through a Scheme Involving Fictitious and Non-
Competitive Trading

Court Enters Restraining Order Freezing Defendantsâ Accounts and
Protecting Books and Records

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today filed a civil enforcement action
charging Defendants Yumin LI, a citizen of the Peopleâs Republic of China, and Kering Capital Ltd., a British Virgin
Islands (BVI) company owned by Liâs mother, with fraud, engaging in fictitious transactions, and trading
noncompetitively, in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Neither Li nor Kering Capital has
ever been registered with the CFTC.

On July 2, 2015, the Honorable Sara L. Ellis, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, issued a restraining
Order freezing Defendantsâ trading accounts and prohibiting them from destroying documents and denying CFTC staff
access to books and records.

The CFTC Complaint, filed on July 1, 2015, alleges that Li was an employee of an individual with trading privileges on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). According to the Complaint, on six separate occasions over the course of seven
weeks between March 17, 2015 and May 6, 2015, Li and Kering Capital engaged in a series of unlawful money passes
involving the Eurodollar contract traded on the CMEâs electronic Globex platform. Li misappropriated approximately
$300,000 from her employer by trading the employerâs account noncompetitively against an account belonging to Kering
Capital that Li controlled, the Complaint charges.

Further, according to the Complaint, in each of the money passes Li placed an order for the Kering Capital account to buy
or sell a Eurodollar âbutterfly spreadâ at a certain quantity and at a certain price. She then placed a second order for her
employerâs account on the opposite side of the market in the same product for the same quantity and the same price.
After the orders were matched, Li entered into offsetting transactions to close out the position. As alleged, in each
instance, Li structured the transactions such that her employerâs account would always buy at higher prices and sell at
lower prices opposite the account Li controlled at Kering Capital, with the result that the Kering Capital account profited
and her employerâs account incurred a loss.

Li concentrated her trading in illiquid Eurodollar contracts with expiration dates that were five or more years beyond the
trade date, according to the Complaint. She also traded outside of regular CME trading hours so that there would be
fewer market participants trading, and she would have a better chance of matching her orders, according to the
Complaint.

According to the complaint, Kering Capital is a trading company formed in the BVI in November 2014 by Liâs mother, who
is its Chief Executive Officer and sole shareholder.

In its continuing litigation, the CFTC seeks restitution, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans, and a
permanent injunction against further violations of the federal commodities laws.

The CFTC thanks the CME Group, Inc. for its assistance in this matter.

The CFTC staff members responsible for this action are Lindsey Evans, Melissa Cavers, David Terrell, Venice Bickham,
Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Orders Chicago-based E*TRADE Securities LLC and E*TRADE Clearing LLC to Paya
$280,000 Civil Monetary Penalty for Failure to Retain Required Records and Failure to
Diligently Supervise

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and settling
charges against E*TRADE Securities LLC (E*TRADE Securities), an Introducing Broker, and E*TRADE Clearing LLC
(E*TRADE Clearing), a Futures Commission Merchant, for non-compliance with applicable record-keeping rules and failure
to diligently supervise. Both entities have their headquarters in Chicago, Illinois.

The CFTC Order finds that between October 2009 and January 25, 2014, E*TRADE Securities did not preserve and
maintain certain audit trail logs for their customers. Similarly, E*TRADE Clearing did not preserve and maintain customer
audit trail logs after becoming registered as a Futures Commission Merchant in February 2013.

Violations of Regulations 1.31 & 1.35

The Order finds that by not preserving and maintaining these records, E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing violated
Section 4g(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC Regulations 1.31 and 1.35.

Regulation 166.3 Violation

In addition, the Order finds that E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing violated CFTC Regulation 166.3 by failing to
implement policies and procedures to ensure the retention of these records and failing to respond to a previous warning
from its vendor that it did not preserve these records

The CFTC Order requires E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing jointly to pay a $280,000 civil monetary penalty and
to cease and desist from further violations of the CEA, as charged. To prevent similar problems in the future, the Order
also requires E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing to improve their recordkeeping procedures by updating their
policies and procedures and providing appropriate training to officers and employees regarding the CEAâs recordkeeping
requirements.

The Order recognizes the cooperation of E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Clearing in this matter.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are AimÃ©e Latimer-Zayets, A. Daniel Ullman Il, and

CFTC Orders JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to Paya
$225,000 Penalty for Inaccurate Large Trader Reports for Physical Commodity Swaps
Positions

Washington - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and simultaneously
settling charges against JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corp. (JPMVE) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMCB)
(collectively, Respondents), for failing to comply with their obligations to submit accurate large trader reports (LTRs) for
physical commodity swap positions, in violation of Section 4s(f) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC
Regulations 20.4 and 20.7.

The CFTC Order requires the Respondents to pay, jointly and severally, a $225,000 civil monetary penalty and to cease
and desist from committing further violations of the CEA and CFTC Regulations, as charged.

As stated in the Order, large trader reporting for physical commodity swaps is essential to the CFTCâs ability to conduct
effective surveillance of markets in U.S. physical commodity futures and economically equivalent swaps. The Order
makes clear that as of March 1, 2013, swap dealers required to submit LTRs are expected to be in full compliance with
the requirements governing LTRs set forth in Regulations 20.4 and 20.7, in conjunction with further instructions provided
in the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight Part 20 Guidebook.

The Order finds that during the period from at least March 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014, the Respondents filed LTRs
that routinely contained errors. The Order finds that these errors included: (1) reporting the underlying commodity,
futures equivalent months, and currency value strike price in the wrong data fields; (2) reporting futures contract
equivalents, commodity units, and notional values that were incorrect or missing; (3) providing identifying information for
principals that attributed positions to the wrong entities; and (4) incorrectly reporting counterparty names. In addition,
the Order finds that the Respondents failed to submit LTRs on two days.

As noted in the Order, the Respondents have made modifications to their data processing and reporting systems as
necessary to comply with their LTR reporting requirements, have corrected errors as they were identified, and have
submitted corrected historical LTRs.

CFTC Division of Market Oversight staff members responsible for this matter are Matthew Hunter, Kenneth Danger, and
Lynn Riggs. CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this matter are Christopher Reed, Stephen
Turley, Michael Solinsky, Thomas Simek, and Charles D. Marvine.

CFTC Wins Forex Fraud Trial on Damages and Obtains Monetary Judgment of More than
$22.6 Million

Court Releases Pallet of Foreign Currency Valued at $2.5M to CFTC

Washington, D.C. â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today announced that following a bench trial the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Alabama entered a final judgment against defendants Husam Tayeh of Illinois
and his companies, Dinar Corp., Inc. and My Monex, Inc., both Nevada corporations. The courtâs ruling orders the
defendants to pay more than $22.6 million in disgorgement and civil monetary penalties in connection with Tayehâs
fraudulent foreign currency (forex) scheme. The court previously found the defendants liable for violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act, including fraud.

âThis ruling reaffirms the CFTCâs commitment to working in parallel with our enforcement counterparts at the federal,
state, and local level,â said CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald. âThe CFTC remains committed to working
closely with other regulators and criminal authorities to root out fraud in our markets. Iâm grateful to the Alabama
Securities Commission, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Middle District of Alabama, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and local law enforcement for their assistance in this matter.â

âWe applaud the work of the CFTC in its successful judgment, and we will continue to assist and engage in cooperative
enforcement efforts with our federal partners to combat fraudulent practices in currency and commodity trading,â said
Alabama Securities Commission Chief Deputy Director Amanda Senn.

The verdict in this case stems from a July 27, 2015 complaint filed by the CFTC. [See CFTC Press Release No. 7206-15]
The complaint charged the defendants with fraudulently soliciting customers to engage in financed retail forex
transactions, primarily involving Iraqi Dinar and Vietnamese Dong, misappropriating customer funds, and various
registration violations. The complaint also charged Theodore S. Hudson, Il and his company, My Monex, Inc., an Alabama
corporation, as relief defendants for receiving funds that were obtained as a result of the defendantsâ fraud and to which
they have no legitimate claim. The CFTCâs charges against Hudson and his company were resolved via consent order of
statutory and equitable relief entered by the court on February 12, 2018.

On February 6, 2018, the court entered an order finding the defendants liable on each of the four counts alleged in the
complaint and imposing a permanent injunction. The defendants consented to liability but left the issues of disgorgement
and civil monetary penalties to be determined by the court. The parties proceeded to trial on August 12, 2019. On
February 14, 2020, U.S. District Court Judge Andrew L. Brasher resolved those issues by entering a final judgment against
the defendants, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $22,559,153 and a civil monetary penalty of $140,000. The court
also entered a memorandum opinion with findings of fact and conclusions of law in the matter.

Court Releases a Pallet of Currency to the CFTC as an Offset Against the Final Judgment

In a separate order, the court released to the CFTC a pallet of Iraqi Dinar and Vietnamese Dong that had been seized
from the defendants as an offset against the final judgment, which, at the time of seizure, was valued at more than $2.5
million USD.

Related Criminal Action

In a related criminal action, on June 7, 2016, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Middle District of Alabama charged Tayeh
by criminal information with one count of wire fraud. [See United States v. Tayeh, Case No. 1:16-cr-213 (M.D. Ala.)].
Tayeh pleaded guilty on June 11, 2016. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year and one day and
ordered to both forfeit more than $8 million and pay $151,517 in restitution to identified victims.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Middle District of Alabama, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, the Alabama Securities Commission, the Dothan, Alabama Police Department, and the Houston County,

Federal Court in California Orders Ralph Metters, aka Malachai âMoeâ Levy, to Paya
$500,000 Penalty and Disgorge $500,000 of Ill-Gotten Gains for Defrauding Investors in a
Foreign Currency Scheme

In a Related Criminal Action, Metters Pleaded Guilty to Conspiracy to
Commit Wire Fraud and Was Sentenced to 108 Months of Imprisonment

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that Judge Manuel L. Real
of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a Consent Order settling CFTC charges against
Defendant Ralph Metters, formerly of Los Angeles, California, imposing a $500,000 civil monetary penalty and requiring
Metters to disgorge $500,000 of ill-gotten gains, in connection with off-exchange foreign currency (forex) fraud in
violation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The Order also permanently enjoins Metters from further violations of
the CEA, as charged, and imposes permanent trading and registration bans on him.

The Courtâs Order, entered on August 8, 2016, stems from a CFTC enforcement Complaint filed on August 20, 2014 (see
CFTC Complaint and Press Release 6987-14, August 29, 2014), charging Metters, also Known as Malachai âMoeâ Levy,
with fraudulently soliciting $500,000 from a member of the public in connection with off-exchange forex transactions
beginning in October 2013.

The Order finds that Metters falsely represented to investors that he would use their money to engage in forex
investments, and their money would be kept in escrow until they authorized its use; victims accordingly invested at least
$745,000. However, Metters took this invested amount out of escrow without investorsâ permission, the Order finds, and
knowingly misappropriated the funds.

In a Related Criminal Action, Metters Ordered to Pay $500,000 in Restitution

In a related criminal action involving, in part, some of the same conduct described above, Metters pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to commit wire fraud in United States of America v. Malachai Levy, aka Ralph Maurice Metters, No. 14-cr-
00635 JFW (C.D. Cal.). On May 16, 2016, the Court sentenced Metters to 108 months of imprisonment, and ordered him
to pay $500,000 restitution to the victim described above, as well as additional restitution to other victims of other
criminal violations.

The CFTC cautions that Orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Central District of California and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

CFTC Orders Rosenthal Collins Capital Markets LLC, Now Known as DV Trading LLC, to
Pay a Civil Penalty of $5 Million for Engaging in Illegal Wash Sales Designed to Generate
Exchange Rebate Fees

Former RCCM Trader Brandon Elsasser also Ordered to Pay $200,000
for Similar Unlawful Trading Conduct

Washington DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced the filing and
simultaneous settlement of charges against Rosenthal Collins Capital Markets, LLC, now known as DV Trading LLC
(RCCM), of Chicago, Illinois, for engaging in illegal wash sales in order to generate rebates of exchange fees based upon
increased trading volumes.

The CFTC Order requires RCCM to pay a $5 million civil monetary penalty and cease and desist from violating Section
A4c(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and Commission Regulation 1.38(a), as charged. A separate CFTC Order
finds that former RCCM trader, Brandon Elsasser (Elsasser), entered illegal wash sales and requires him to pay a
$200,000 civil monetary penalty, and orders him to cease and desist from violating CEA Section 4c(a) and Commission
Regulation 1.38(a), as charged.

Three Different Strategies

The CFTC Order finds that from early 2013 until July 2015, proprietary traders at RCCM engaged in three different wash
trading strategies in order to generate rebates through the Eurodollar Pack and Bundle Market Maker Program (Program)
offered by Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (CME). Under the terms of the Program, RCCM had certain quoting
obligations and, in return, it could earn rebates in the form of fee credits for its trading in the Program.

The Order specifically finds that in early 2013, in order to generate the firmâs desired level of rebates apart from actual
market conditions, an RCCM trader evaded RCCMâs wash blocking system in order to trade against himself and generate
rebates. He continued generating rebates using wash trades until his trading was detected and RCCM tightened its wash
blocking system.

The Order further finds that a few months later, two RCCM traders began engaging in prolonged periods of scratch
trading, that is, buying and selling opposite each other, in order to generate the rebates. They continued trading in that
manner until the CME informed RCCM that it would exclude trades among RCCM traders from the rebate calculations.

Brandon Elsasser Order

Shortly after that time, RCCM trader Elsasser discovered a third strategy in which he could trade against himself in
rebate-eligible products and avoid detection using the exchangeâs implied matching engine to buy and sell contracts.
The Elsasser Order, also filed on June 29, 2017, finds that Elsasser engaged in fictitious trading strategies in order to
generate rebates from the Program.

RCCMâs compliance efforts did not detect or investigate any of these strategies until they were brought to RCCMâs
attention by regulatory inquiries, the Order finds. In total, RCCM earned rebates on approximately 300,000 Eurodollar
contracts through more than 8,000 wash transactions while trading in the market maker program.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the CFTCâs Division of Market Oversight and the CME Group, Inc.

The following Division of Enforcement staff members are responsible for this matter: Lindsey Evans, Elizabeth N.
Pendleton, Joseph Patrick, Jeffrey Gomberg, Heather Dasso, Jason Fairbanks, Ava Gould, Scott R. Williamson, and
Rosemary Hollinger.

Brandon Elsasser Order
Shortly after that time, RCCM trader Elsasser discovered a third strategy in which he could trade against himself in rebate-eligible products and avoid detection using the exchange’s implied matching engine to buy and sell contracts.
 The Elsasser Order, also filed on June 29, 2017, finds that Elsasser engaged in fictitious trading strategies in order to generate rebates from the Program.

RCCM’s compliance efforts did not detect or investigate any of these strategies until they were brought to RCCM’s attention by regulatory inquiries, the Order finds. In total, RCCM earned rebates on approximately 300,000 Eurodollar contracts through more than 8,000 wash transactions while trading in the market maker program.

CFTC Orders Goldman Sachs to Pay $120 Million Penalty for Attempted Manipulation of
and False Reporting of U.S. Dollar ISDAFIX Benchmark Swap Rates

Todayâs Action Is the CFTCâs Third Enforcement Action for the
Attempted Manipulation and False Reporting of ISDAFIX Benchmark
Rates

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued an Order today filing and settling
charges against The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and Goldman, Sachs & Co. (collectively, Goldman or the Bank).
The Order finds that, beginning in January 2007 and continuing through March 2012 (the Relevant Period), Goldman
attempted, by and through certain of its traders in New York, on many occasions to manipulate and made false reports
concerning the U.S. Dollar International Swaps and Derivatives Association Fix (USD ISDAFIX), a global benchmark for
interest rate products. Goldmanâs unlawful conduct involved multiple traders, including the head of Goldmanâs Interest
Rate Products Trading Group in the United States, according to the CFTC Order.

The CFTC Order requires Goldman to pay a $120 million civil monetary penalty, cease and desist from further violations
as charged, and take specified remedial steps, including measures 1) to detect and deter trading intended to manipulate
swap rates such as USD ISDAFIX, 2) to ensure the integrity and reliability of the Bankâs benchmark submissions, and 3) to
improve related internal controls. The Order also requires the current supervisor responsible for oversight of various
United States interest-rate trading desks at Goldman to provide a certification as to, among other things, the
effectiveness of the internal controls and procedures undertaken and implemented by Goldman as a result of this
settlement.

âThis matter, the third enforcement action relating to the ISDAFIX benchmark, demonstrates the breadth of this kind of
misconduct across the industry, and within Goldman, the extent of the misconduct across trading desks and product
lines,â commented Aitan Goelman, the CFTCâs Director of Enforcement. Mr. Goelman further commented that âthe
Division will continue to be vigilant and aggressive in protecting the integrity of the ISDAFIX and other important
benchmarks relied upon by the markets.â

Goldman, through its traders, bid, offered, and executed transactions in interest rate swap spreads, U.S. Treasuries, and
Eurodollar futures contracts in a manner deliberately designedâin timing, price, and other respectsâto influence the
published USD ISDAFIX in order to benefit the Bank in its derivatives positions, according to the Order. In addition,
Goldman, through its employees making the Bankâs USD ISDAFIX submissions, also attempted to manipulate and made
false reports concerning USD ISDAFIX by skewing the Bankâs submissions in order to benefit the Bank at the expense of
its derivatives counterparties and clients.

USD ISDAFIX

ISDAFIX rates and spreads are among the leading benchmarks for interest rate swaps and related derivatives, indicating
the prevailing, daily market rate for the fixed leg of a standard fixed-for-floating interest rate swap in various currencies.
USD ISDAFIX rates and spreads are published daily (now under a different name and methodology) for various maturities
of U.S. Dollar-denominated swaps. The USD ISDAFIX rate is used for valuing cash settlement of options on interest rate
swaps, or swaptions, and as a valuation tool for a wide range of products across financial markets. For example, during
the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was used in settlement of exchange-traded interest rate swap futures contracts and as
a component in the calculation of various constant maturity swaps, spreadlocks, proprietary interest rate indexes, and
other structured products. Many parties, including pension funds and local and state governments in the United States,
rely on such instruments based on USD ISDAFIX to hedge against changes in interest rates.

During the Relevant Period, USD ISDAFIX was set each day in a process that began at exactly 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time
with the capture and recording of swap rates and spreads from a U.S.-based unit of a leading interest rate swaps broking
firm, which disseminated the rates and spreads captured in this 11:00 a.m. âsnapshot,â âfix,â or âprintââas it was
referred to by traders and brokersâto a panel of banks including Goldman. The banks then made submissions to indicate
where they would each bid or offer interest rate swaps to a dealer of good credit.

Goldmanâs Unlawful Conduct to Benefit Derivatives Positions

As found in the Order, Goldman attempted to manipulate USD ISDAFIX through its trading at the 11:00 a.m. fixing as well
as by skewing the Bankâs submissions, in order to benefit a range of derivatives positions held by Goldman that were
priced or valued against the USD ISDAFIX benchmark.
Goldman traders bid, offered, and executed transactions of swap spreads, U.S. Treasuries, and Eurodollar futures
contracts at the critical 11:00 a.m. fixing time with the intent to affect the âprint,â i.e., the reference rates captured at
11:00 a.m. and sent to submitting banks, and thereby to affect the published USD ISDAFIX. As captured in emails and
audio recordings, when Goldman had derivatives positions settling or pricing against USD ISDAFIX, Goldman traders
discussed their intent to move USD ISDAFIX in whichever direction benefitted their positions. Goldman traders stated
their manipulative goals in plain language, such as directing their swap broker to âspend what you need, but make SURE
we get the print,â and even objected when their attempts to manipulate were not performed as inexpensively as
possible, such as when the former head of Goldmanâs swap trading desk complained, âI should control the screen without
having to given [sic] some loser another [trade].â

Among themselves, Goldman traders described trades based on the manipulated USD ISDAFIX as being based on the
âjacked price,â aS opposed to the âfair priceâ; remarked that other Goldman traders had âgamed the fixâ in order to
benefit related positions; and strategized how best to extract the âhigher valueâ of USD ISDAFIX cash settlements against
customers who lacked Goldmanâs view, as a major swap dealer, into the USD ISDAFIX setting process.

To complement these efforts, as found in the Order, on many occasions during the Relevant Period, Goldman traders
made USD ISDAFIX submissions higher or lower for the purpose of benefitting derivative positions priced or valued
against the benchmark. As the Order finds, these submissions by Goldman were false, misleading, or knowingly
inaccurate because they did not report where Goldman would itself bid and offer swaps absent a desire to manipulate the
USD ISDAFIX, but rather reflected prices that were more favorable to the Bankâs specific derivatives positions.

The Order describes multiple examples of each of these strategies for attempted manipulation and false reporting by
Goldman traders during the Relevant Period.

The Order notes that prior to the latter stages of the Divisionâs investigation, Goldmanâs cooperation was not satisfactory.
Goldman did not make certain productions as expeditiously as the Division expected and initially failed to produce
certain communications and documents that were potentially relevant to identifying misconduct. The Order recognizes
that Goldman took remedial action to improve internal controls and policies related to ISDAFIX and its successor
benchmark.

The CFTC thanks and acknowledges the assistance of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and the Newark, New Jersey
Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this case are Candice Aloisi, Gates S. Hurand, Trevor Kokal,

CFTC Orders Florida Residents Isaiah Goldman and Brock Catronio and their Companies,
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC and Paramount Credit, LLC, to Pay More than $2.5
Million in Sanctions for Engaging in Illegal, Off-Exchange Precious Metals Transactions

Washington, DC - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today issued an Order filing and
simultaneously settling charges against Isaiah Goldman and Brock Catronio, individually, and their companies,
Paramount Metals Exchange, LLC and Paramount Credit, LLC (collectively Paramount), both of Delray Beach,
Florida, for engaging in illegal, off-exchange precious metals transactions. Goldman resides in Boca Raton, Florida, and
Catronio resides in Delray Beach.

The CFTC Order requires Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount jointly to pay restitution of $1,595,946 to their customers
and jointly to pay a $1 million civil monetary penalty. In addition, the Order imposes permanent registration and trading
bans on Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount.

The Order finds that, from December 2011 through February 2013, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount solicited retail
customers to engage in outright cash purchases of precious metals, falsely claiming to sell and transfer title of physical
metals to customers and to arrange for the transfer and storage of the physical metals in independent depositories
where such metal was purportedly held on the customersâ behalf.

The Order states that unknown to Paramount customers, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount instead treated the
customersâ transactions as financed purchases of metal in which the retail customer only paid a portion of the purchase
price and took out a loan for the balance of the purchase price. According to the Order, Paramountâs customers paid a
total of $3,306,032 and lost $1,595,946 of their funds to trading losses, commissions, interest charges, and other fees to
Paramount and another company. Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount received $853,279 of those commissions and fees.
Thus, the Order finds that, among other specific findings, Goldman, Catronio, and Paramount engaged in illegal, off-
exchange transactions and committed fraud, violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, financed transactions such as those
conducted by Paramount, are illegal off-exchange transactions unless they result in actual delivery of metal within 28
days. According to the Order, Paramountâs retail financed precious metals transactions executed through Hunter Wise
Commodities LLC did not result in actual delivery to the customer. In addition, as explained in the CFTC Order, financed
transactions such as these must be executed on or subject to the rules of an exchange approved by the CFTC, which
Paramount did not do.

The CFTC cautions that restitution orders may not result in the recovery of money lost because the wrongdoers may not
have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure
the wrongdoers are held accountable.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Susan B. Padove, Heather Johnson, Elizabeth
M. Streit, Scott Williamson, and Rosemary Hollinger.

CFTC Wins Judgment against Commodities Trader for Commodity Pool Fraud, Including
Misappropriating Funds

Washington, DC â The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced today that Defendant Mark R.
Slobodnik of Libertyville, Illinois, has been ordered to pay approximately $370,000 in fines in connection with a $1.76
million commodity pool fraud operated under the name Blue Guru, LLC.

Judge Manish Shah, of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, entered a Consent Order for Permanent
Injunction on November 9, 2018 that requires Slobodnik to pay restitution totaling $280,000, disgorge $45,342.44 of ill-
gotten gains and pay a civil monetary penalty of $45,342.44. The Order also imposes a five year trading and registration
ban on Slobodnik and prohibits him from violating provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act as charged.

The Order stems from a CFTC Complaint filed on January 12, 2018 (see CFTC Complaint and Press Release 7672-18),
which charged Slobodnik, a former member of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), and co-defendants Richard D.
Carter and Blue Guru, LLC with fraud, misappropriation and failing to register with the CFTC. The Order finds that from
April 2014 to the filing of the Complaint, Slobodnik willfully misrepresented material facts to participants and prospective
participants of Blue Guru concerning the profits they were making on their participation interests in the commodity pool.
Among the misrepresentations, Slobodnik told prospective and actual participants that Blue Guru would use their money
to trade futures, including the Dow Jones E-mini and the S&P 500 E-mini contracts on the CME, when, in fact, the
defendants used less than two-thirds of the $1.76 million they solicited and received for trading. According to the Order,
Slobodnik informed prospective participants that they would earn 8 percent per year on their investment plus 50 percent
of any gross net trading profits, and was present or aware of communications advising participants that their funds were
earning consistent trading profits. In fact, the Order finds that Slobodnik was responsible for approximately $249,000 of
the $501,000 in trading losses incurred by Blue Guru.

The Order also finds that Slobodnik misappropriated $45,342.44 of participantsâ funds and that when participants
requested to withdraw their funds from Blue Guru, Slobodnik and his partner ignored their demands, engaged in delay
tactics, and lied about conditions that purportedly prevented them from making disbursements.

Earlier in the litigation, Judge Shah entered an Order for Injunction, Civil Monetary Penalties, And Other Statutory and
Equitable Relief Against Defendant Blue Guru, LLC by default on May 1, 2018 and ordered Blue Guru to pay restitution of
$1,400,076.78, disgorgement of $1,400,076.78 and a civil monetary penalty of $4,200,230.34. The case remains
pending against Carter.

The CFTC cautions that Orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost
because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the
protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.

The CFTC thanks the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Federal Bureau of Investigation for
their assistance.

CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members responsible for this action are Susan Gradman, Joseph Patrick, Brigitte
Weyls, Scott Williamson and Rosemary Hollinger.
