SEC SUES ABB LTD IN FOREIGN BRIBERY CASE

ABB SETTLES FEDERAL COURT ACTION
AND AGREES TO DISGORGE $5.9 MILLION IN ILLICIT
PROFITS

TWO ABB AFFILIATES ALSO PLEAD GUILTY

AND AGREE TO PAY $10.5 MILLION IN FINES

IN CRIMINAL CASE BROUGHT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE

Securities and Exchange Commission v. ABB Ltd, Case No.
1:04CV1141 [RBW] (U.S.D.C., D.D.C.)

On July 6, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a settled
enforcement action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia charging ABB Ltd, a global provider of power and automation
technologies headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, with violating the anti-
bribery, books-and-records, and internal-accounting-controls provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Simultaneously with the filing of the
complaint, and without admitting or denying its allegations, ABB consented to
the entry of a final judgment enjoining it from future FCPA violations, and
requiring it (i) to pay $5.9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest,
(ii) to pay a $10.5 million penalty, which would be deemed satisfied by two of
its affiliatesâ payments of criminal fines totaling the same amount in parallel
criminal proceedings brought by the Department of Justice; and (iii) to retain
an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA compliance policies
and procedures.

In its complaint, the Commission charged that, from 1998 through early 2003,
ABB's U.S. and foreign-based subsidiaries doing business in Nigeria, Angola
and Kazakhstan, offered and made illicit payments totaling over $1.1 million
to government officials in these countries. According to the complaint, all of
the payments were made to influence acts and decisions by the foreign
officials receiving the payments, in order to assist ABB's subsidiaries in
obtaining and retaining business. The complaint further alleged that the
payments were made with the knowledge and approval of certain
management level personnel of the relevant ABB subsidiaries, and that at
least $865,726 of the payments were made after ABB became a reporting
company in the United States in April 2001. Finally, the complaint charged
that ABB improperly recorded these payments in its accounting books and
records, and lacked any meaningful internal controls to prevent or detect
such illicit payments.

According to the Commission, by making these payments through its
subsidiaries, ABB violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA (Section 30A
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The Commission further charged
that, by improperly recording these payments, ABB violated the books-and-
records provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934). Finally, the Commission charged that, by failing to devise or
maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect these
violations of the FCPA, ABB violated the internal accounting controls
provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934).

In determining to accept ABB's settlement offer, the Commission considered
the full cooperation that ABB provided to the Commission staff during its
investigation. The Commission also considered the fact that ABB brought this
matter to the attention of the Commission's staff and the U.S. Department of
Justice. Based in part upon ABB's cooperation, the Commission determined to
allow ABB's $10.5 million civil penalty obligation to be deemed satisfied by
two of its affiliates' payments of criminal fines totaling $10.5 million ina
parallel criminal proceeding brought by the U.S. Department of Justice.

In that parallel proceeding, also announced today, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against two ABB subsidiaries, who entered
guilty pleas before the Honorable Vanessa Gilmore, United States District
Judge for the Southern District of Texas: Houston-based ABB Vetco Gray, Inc.,
and Aberdeen, Scotland-based ABB Vetco Gray UK, Ltd. (United States v. ABB
Vetco Gray, Inc. and ABB Vetco Gray UK, Ltd., Case No. 04-CR-279-01 (S.D.
Texas)). In particular, ABB Vetco Gray, Inc. and ABB Vetco Gray UK, Ltd. each
agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating the anti-bribery
provisions of the FCPA and to pay criminal fines that, between them, total
$10.5 million.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in
its investigation, which is continuing.

Chevron to Pay $30 Million to Settle Charges For
Improper Payments to Iraq Under U.N. Oil For Food
Program

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-230

Washington, D.C., Nov. 14, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Chevron Corporation for its role in illegal kickback payments
that were made to Iraq in 2001 and 2002 in connection with the company's
purchases of crude oil under the U.N. Oil for Food Program.

Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., agreed to pay $30 million to settle the
charges brought under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) without
admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.

The U.N. Oil for Food Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief to
the Iraqi people while Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions.
According to the Commission's complaint, third parties under contract with
Chevron made approximately $20 million in illicit payments that bypassed the
Oil for Food escrow account and were paid directly to Iraqi-controlled bank
accounts in Jordan and Lebanon. The SEC alleged that Chevron knew, or
should have known, that third parties were using portions of the premiums
they received from Chevron's oil purchases to pay illegal surcharges to Iraq.
The SEC also alleged that Chevron failed to devise and maintain a system of
internal accounting controls to detect and prevent such illicit payments, and
Chevron's accounting for its Oil for Food transactions failed to properly record
the true nature of the company's payments to third parties.

""This is the Commission's fifth action against a company for participating in
the Oil for Food kickback scheme and demonstrates our continuing
commitment to combating violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,""
said Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.

Cheryl Scarboro, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, added,
""The Commission will continue to vigorously enforce the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to combat
illicit kickbacks.""

According to the Commission's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York, Chevron learned of surcharge demands by
Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) in January 2001 and adopted a
company-wide policy prohibiting their payment. The policy required traders to
obtain prior written approval for all proposed Iraqi oil purchases and charged
management with reviewing each proposed Iraqi oil deal.

Chevron subsequently purchased approximately 78 million barrels of crude oil
from Iraq pursuant to 36 contracts with third parties from April 17, 2001,
through May 6, 2002. In doing so, the Commission alleges, Chevron's traders
failed to follow the company-wide policy and Chevron's management did not
ensure compliance. Despite being required to consider the identity,
experience and reputation of a third-party seller prior to approving a proposed
Iraqi oil purchase, Chevron's management relied on its traders'
representations.

In one instance, a credit check by Chevron of a proposed third-party seller
revealed that the seller was a ""brass plate company."" This meant that the
company had no experience in the oil business, no real business operations,
and no known assets. Despite concerns on the part of Chevron's
management, Chevron entered into two transactions to purchase three
million barrels of oil from the third party in January 2002. Illegal surcharges
were paid on both of these transactions and passed back to Chevron in
inflated premiums that Chevron paid to the third party.

Also according to the SEC's complaint, a third-party seller whose company
occasionally sold oil to Chevron stated that the trader he dealt with at
Chevron and the trader's bosses always knew about the illegal surcharge
demands by Iraq. The Chevron trader asked the third-party seller to persuade
Iraq to reduce the amount of its surcharges. Despite Chevron's premium
payments to third parties increasing after Iraq's surcharge demands began,
Chevron's management routinely approved the Iraqi oil purchases proposed
by its traders.

Chevron consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it
from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering it to disgorge $25 million in profits and
pay a $3 million civil penalty. Chevron also will pay the Office of Foreign Asset
Controls of the U.S. Department of Treasury a penalty of $2 million. Chevron
will satisfy its disgorgement obligation by forfeiting $20 million pursuant to an
agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New
York and paying disgorgement of $5 million pursuant to an agreement with
the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for
the Southern District of New York, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office,
the Office of Foreign Asset Controls at the U.S. Department of Treasury, and
the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee. The Commission also
acknowledges Chevron's cooperation in the investigation. The SEC's Oil for
Food investigation is continuing.

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1464

SEC v. Chiquita Brands International, Inc., Civ. Action No.
1:01CV02079 (D.D.C.)(filed October 3, 2001)

Sec Settles Case against Chiquita Brands International, Inc.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today issued a settled cease-and-
desist order against Chiquita Brands International, Inc. in which the
Commission finds that Chiquita violated the books and records â Section
13(b)(2)(A) â and internal accounting controls â Section 13(b)(2)(B) â
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with a
payment to foreign customs officials by a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of
Chiquita. Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Chiquita
consented to the entry of an order that requires Chiquita to cease and desist
from violating those provisions. The Commission also filed a settled complaint
in federal court seeking entry of a consent order requiring Chiquita to pay a
$100,000 civil penalty. Chiquita settled the action without admitting or
denying the Commission's allegations.

The order finds that Chiquita violated the books and records and internal
controls provisions as a result of the conduct of its Colombian subsidiary,
Banadex. According to the order, without the knowledge or consent of any
Chiquita employees outside Colombia and in contravention of Chiquita's
policies, employees of Banadex authorized the payment of the equivalent of
$30,000 to local customs officials to secure renewal of a license at Banadex's
Turbo, Colombia port facility. The subsidiary's books and records incorrectly
identified the two installment payments, which were made in 1996 and 1997.
In 1997, Chiquita's internal audit staff discovered the payment during an audit
review and, after an internal investigation, Chiquita took corrective action
which included terminating the responsible Banadex employees and
reinforcing internal controls at Banadex.

SEC Charges Willbros Group and Former Employees with
Foreign Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2008-86

Washington, D.C., May 14, 2008 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed a settled enforcement action charging Willbros Group, Inc. and
four former employees with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA), alleging that they paid more than $6 million in undisclosed bribes to
Nigerian government officials and others to obtain significant contracts for the
Houston-based company.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release
Â®Â» SEC Complaint

 

Willbros Group has agreed to pay $10.3 million to settle the SECâs charges,
and the four other defendants also agreed to settle the charges against them
without admitting or denying the allegations. The SECâs complaint names
Jason Steph, a former supervisory employee in Nigeria; Gerald Jansen, a
former administrative supervisor in Nigeria; Lloyd Biggers, a former employee
in Nigeria; and Carlos Galvez, a former accounting employee in Bolivia.

âThis case demonstrates the Commissionâs continued vigorous enforcement
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Rose Romero, Regional Director of
the SECâs Fort Worth Regional Office. âWe will not allow companies to use
illicit payments to alter the competitive balance of the marketplace, as
alleged here.â

The anti-bribery provisions of FCPA prohibit corrupt payments to foreign
officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business, and the
corresponding accounting provisions in the federal securities laws require
adequate disclosure of payments.

The SEC alleges that, beginning in at least 2003, Willbros Group engaged ina
scheme to pay more than $6 million in undisclosed bribes to Nigerian
government officials and employees of an operator of a joint venture majority-
owned by the Nigerian government in order to obtain two significant contracts
that resulted in net profits of nearly $9 million. The SECâs complaint further
alleges that Willbros Group and former employees used fabricated invoices to
obtain cash from the companyâs Houston headquarters to bribe Nigerian tax
and court officials.

The SECâs complaint also alleges that Willbros Group and employees schemed
to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil-and-gas company owned by the
Ecuador government in order to obtain a $3 million contract, and
implemented a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme in Bolivia that resulted in
material misstatements in Willbros Groupâs financial statements.

The SEC alleges that Willbros Group violated Sections 30A, 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)
(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1
and 13a-13 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. Willbros
Group has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future
violations of these provisions and an order to pay $8.9 million disgorgement,
plus $1.4 million in prejudgment interest.

The SEC alleges that Stephâs actions in Nigeria violated Sections 30A and
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and
abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the
Exchange Act. Steph consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from
future violations of these provisions. Pursuant to the judgment, the court will
determine later whether Steph will pay a penalty.

The SEC alleges that Jansenâs role in the Nigerian bribes violated Section
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and
abetted violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the
Exchange Act. He has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from
future violations of these provisions and to an order to pay a $30,000 civil
penalty.

The SEC alleges that the conduct of Biggers in Nigeria violated Section 13(b)
(5) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 30A of the Exchange Act. He has
consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of
these provisions.

The SEC alleges that the conduct of Galvez in Bolivia violated Section 13(b)(5)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and aided and abetted
violations of Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Galvez
has consented to the entry of a permanent injunction from future violations of
these provisions and an order to pay a $35,000 civil penalty.

The Commission acknowledges Willbros Group's cooperation in the
investigation.

In a related criminal proceeding, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a
criminal Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement in the Southern
District of Texas relating to the criminal FCPA charges against Willbros Group
and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. (Willbros International). In that
case, Willbros Group and Willbros International accepted responsibility for its
employees that had violated the FCPA and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of
$22 million. Pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the Department
of Justice agreed to defer prosecution of these companies for three years and
the companies agreed to retain for a period of three years an independent
compliance monitor to assess the companyâs implementation of and
compliance with new internal policies and procedures. If Willbros Group and
Willbros International abide by the terms of the agreement, the Department
will dismiss the Information when the term of the agreement ends.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in this
investigation.

(Willbros International). In that case, Willbros Group and Willbros International accepted responsibility for its employees that had violated the FCPA and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $22 million. Pursuant to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the Department of Justice agreed to defer prosecution of these companies for three years and the companies agreed to retain for a period of three years an independent compliance monitor to assess the company’s implementation of and compliance with new internal policies and procedures. If Willbros Group and Willbros International abide by the terms of the agreement, the Department will dismiss the Information when the term of the agreement ends.

SEC Announces Non-Prosecution Agreement With Raloh Lauren
Corporation Involving FCPA Misconduct

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-65

Washington, D.C., April 22, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with
Ralph Lauren Corporation in which the company will disgorge more than $700,000 in illicit profits and interest obtained in connection with
bribes paid by a subsidiary to government officials in Argentina from 2005 to 2009. The misconduct was uncovered in an internal review
undertaken by the company and promptly reported to the SEC.

The SEC has determined not to charge Ralph Lauren Corporation with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) due to the
company's prompt reporting of the violations on its own initiative, the completeness of the information it provided, and its extensive,
thorough, and real-time cooperation with the SEC's investigation. Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation saved the agency substantial time
and resources ordinarily consumed in investigations of comparable conduct.

The NPA is the first that the SEC has entered involving FCPA misconduct. NPAs are part of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cooperation
Initiative, which rewards cooperation in SEC investigations. In parallel criminal proceedings, the Justice Department entered into an NPA with
Ralph Lauren Corporation in which the company will pay an $882,000 penalty.

""When they found a problem, Ralph Lauren Corporation did the right thing by immediately reporting it to the SEC and providing exceptional
assistance in our investigation,"" said George S. Canellos, Acting Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""The NPA in this matter makes
clear that we will confer substantial and tangible benefits on companies that respond appropriately to violations and cooperate fully with the
SEC.""

Kara Brockmeyer, the SEC's FCPA Unit Chief, added, ""This NPA shows the benefit of implementing an effective compliance program. Ralph
Lauren Corporation discovered this problem after it put in place an enhanced compliance program and began training its employees. That
level of self-policing along with its self-reporting and cooperation led to this resolution.""

According to the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation included:

e Reporting preliminary findings of its internal investigation to the staff within two weeks of discovering the illegal payments and gifts.
e Voluntarily and expeditiously producing documents.
e Providing English language translations of documents to the staff.
e Summarizing witness interviews that the company's investigators conducted overseas.
e Making overseas witnesses available for staff interviews and bringing witnesses to the U.S.
According to the NPA, the bribes occurred during a period when Ralph Lauren Corporation lacked meaningful anti-corruption compliance and

control mechanisms over its Argentine subsidiary. The misconduct came to light as a result of the company adopting measures to improve its
worldwide internal controls and compliance efforts, including implementation of an FCPA compliance training program in Argentina.

As outlined in the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation's Argentine subsidiary paid bribes to government and customs officials to improperly secure
the importation of Ralph Lauren Corporation's products in Argentina. The purpose of the bribes, paid through its customs broker, was to
obtain entry of Ralph Lauren Corporation's products into the country without necessary paperwork, avoid inspection of prohibited products,
and avoid inspection by customs officials. The bribe payments and gifts to Argentine officials totaled $593,000 during a four-year period.

Under the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation agreed to pay $593,000 in disgorgement and $141,845.79 in prejudgment interest.

The SEC took into account the significant remedial measures undertaken by Ralph Lauren Corporation, including a comprehensive new
compliance program throughout its operations. Among Ralph Lauren Corporation's remedial measures have been new compliance training,
termination of employment and business arrangements with all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, and strengthening its internal controls
and its procedures for third party due diligence. Ralph Lauren Corporation also conducted a risk assessment of its major operations worldwide
to identify any other compliance problems. Ralph Lauren Corporation has ceased operations in Argentina.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kristin A. Snyder and FCPA Unit Assistant Director Tracy L. Davis in the San Francisco Regional
Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District
of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.

SEC Charges Former Software Executive With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-165

Washington D.C., Aug. 12, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a former executive at a worldwide
software manufacturer has agreed to settle charges that he violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing Panamanian
government officials through an intermediary to procure software license sales.

An SEC investigation found that Vicente E. Garcia, the former vice president of global and strategic accounts for SAP SE, orchestrated a
scheme to pay $145,000 in bribes to one government official and promised to pay two others in order to obtain four contracts to sell SAP
software to the Panamanian government. He essentially caused SAP, which is headquartered in Germany and executes most of its sales
through a network of worldwide corporate partners, to sell software to a partner in Panama at discounts of up to 82 percent. The excessive
discounts enabled the partner to create a slush fund from its excessive earnings on the other end of the sales and tap that money to pay the
bribes to Panamanian government officials so SAP could sell the software. Garcia, who lives in Miami, also received kickbacks from the slush
fund into his bank account.

In a parallel action, the U.S. Department of Justice today announced a criminal action against Garcia.

âGarcia attempted to avoid detection by arranging large, illegitimate discounts to a corporate partner in order to generate a cash pot to bribe
government officials and win business for SAP,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:

e The scheme lasted from 2009 to 2013.

e Garcia circumvented SAPâs internal controls by submitting various approval forms to SAP that falsified the reasons for the excessive
discounts to the local partner.

e Garcia used his SAP e-mail account and his personal e-mail account to communicate details of the bribery scheme and even identify
the government officials and intended monetary amounts.

e In an e-mail to one government official, Garcia attached a letter on SAP letterhead detailing fictional meetings in Mexico as requested
by the official in order to justify a trip there on false pretenses. The next day, Garcia sent a subsequent e-mail asking, âAny news ...?
Was the document OK for him? Can you ask him to finalize a deal for us in Feb-March, | need between $5 and $10 million.â

The SECâs order finds that Garcia violated the anti-bribery and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Garcia
consented to the entry of the cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $85,965, which is the total amount of kickbacks he
received, plus prejudgment interest of $6,430 for a total of $92,395.

The SECâs continuing investigation is being conducted by Ansu Banerjee and supervised by Alka Patel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of
the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California, and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SEC Charges Two Former Och-Ziff Executives With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2017-34

Washington D.C., Jan. 26, 2017 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former executives at Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group with being the driving forces behind a far-reaching bribery scheme that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Och-Ziff and two other executives previously settled charges against them in the case.

The SECâs complaint filed today alleges that Michael L. Cohen, who headed Och-Ziffâs European office, and an investment executive on Africa-
related deals, Vanja Baros, caused tens of millions of dollars in bribes to be paid to high-level government officials in Africa. Their alleged
misconduct induced the Libyan Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund to invest in Och-Ziff managed funds. Cohen and Baros also
allegedly directed illicit efforts to secure mining deals to benefit Och-Ziff by directing bribes to corruptly influence government officials in
Chad, Niger, Guinea, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

âAs alleged in our complaint, Cohen and Baros were the masterminds of Och-Ziffâs bribery scheme that improperly used investor funds to pay
bribes through agents and partners to officials at the highest levels of foreign governments,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SECâs FCPA
Unit.

The SECâs complaint charges Cohen and Baros with violating the FCPA and Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act, and aiding and
abetting Och-Ziffâs violations. Cohen also is charged with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act. The SEC is
seeking monetary penalties against Cohen and Baros among other remedies.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Neil Smith and Paul Block of the FCPA Unit and Rory Alex of the Boston Regional Office. The
litigation is being led by Marc Jones and Martin Healey of the Boston office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the

SEC Charges Former Executive at Tampa-Based Engineering
Firm With FCPA Violations

Company to Pay $3.4 Million in Deferred Prosecution Agreement

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2015-13

Washington D.C., Jan. 22, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a former officer at a Tampa, Fla.-based
engineering and construction firm with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by offering and authorizing bribes and employment
to foreign officials to secure Qatari government contracts.

The SEC also announced a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with The PBS} Corporation that defers FCPA charges for a period of two
years and requires the company to comply with certain undertakings. PBS] must immediately pay $3.4 million in financial remedies as part of
the agreement, which reflects the companyâs significant cooperation with the SEC investigation. PBS] is now known as The Atkins North
America Holdings Corporation and no longer offers public stock in the U.S.

An SEC investigation found that Walid Hatoum, who has agreed to settle the SECâs charges, offered to funnel funds to a local company owned
and controlled by a foreign official in order to secure two multi-million Qatari government contracts for PBS] in 2009. The foreign official
subsequently provided Hatoum and PBS|âs international subsidiary with access to confidential sealed-bid and pricing information that enabled
the PBS] subsidiary to tender winning bids for a hotel resort development project in Morocco and a light rail transit project in Qatar.

âHatoum offered and authorized nearly $1.4 million in bribes disguised as âagency feesâ intended for a foreign official who used an alias to
communicate confidential information that assisted PBS],â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âPBS}
ignored multiple red flags that should have enabled other officers and employees to uncover the bribery scheme at an earlier stage. But
once discovered, the company self-reported the potential FCPA violations and cooperated substantially.â

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Hatoum, he also offered employment to a second foreign
official in return for assistance as the bribery scheme began to unravel and PBS] lost the hotel resort contract. Even though the bribes
themselves were not consummated before the scheme was uncovered by the company, PBS] earned approximately $2.9 million in illicit
profits because it continued work on the light rail project until a replacement company could be found.

Under the DPA, PBS] agreed to pay disgorgement and interest of $3,032,875 and a penalty of $375,000. PBSJ took quick steps to end the
misconduct after self-reporting to the SEC, and the company voluntarily made witnesses available for interviews and provided factual
chronologies, timelines, internal summaries, and full forensic images to cooperate with the SECâs investigation.

The SECâs order against Hatoum finds that he violated the anti-bribery, internal accounting controls, books and records, and false records
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Hatoum agreed to pay a penalty of $50,000.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by FCPA Unit members Tracy L. Price and Jim Valentino. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 19821 / September 6, 2006

SEC v. Steven J, Ott and Roger Michael Young, Civil Action No. 06-
4195 (GEB) (D.N.J.)

SEC Sues Two Former Executives of ITXC Corp. for Violations of the
Anti-Bribery Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

On September 6, 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil
enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey
against two former executives of ITXC Corp. (ITXC). Steven J. Ott, the former
Vice President for Global Sales, and Roger Michael Young, the former
Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, were charged with violating
the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997
(FCPA), as amended, which is codified as Section 30A of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The complaint also alleges that Ott and
Young caused ITXC to record the bribes as legitimate business expenses on
its books and records, which violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and
Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and aided and abetted ITXC's violations of
Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).

ITXC was a publicly-held international telecommunications carrier based in
Princeton, New Jersey that sought to do business in Africa. According to the
complaint, Ott and Young approved, and in some cases negotiated, bribes
that ITXC paid to senior officials of government-owned telephone companies
in Nigeria, Rwanda and Senegal, in order to obtain contracts that were
necessary for ITXC to be able to transmit telephone calls to individuals and
businesses in those countries. The complaint alleges that Ott and Young were
responsible for $267,468.95 in bribes that ITXC paid between August 2001
and May 2004. The complaint further alleges that ITXC made $11,509,733 in
net profits from the contracts. In 2004, ITXC merged with Teleglobe
International Holdings Ltd., which was subsequently acquired by Videsh
Sanchar Nigam Ltd. in 2006.

The Commission is seeking injunctions, disgorgement of all ill-gotten gains
derived from the alleged misconduct (with prejudgment interest thereon) and
civil penalties against Ott and Young.

The Commission's complaint is related to the previously filed case SEC v. Yaw
Ose/ Amoako, Civ. No. 05-4284 (GEB) (D.N.J.). See Litigation Release No.
19356.

The Commission's investigation is continuing.

SEC Charges Cognizant and Two Former Executives With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2019-12

Washington D.C., Feb. 15, 2019 â Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation has agreed to pay $25 million to settle charges that it
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and two of the companyâs former executives were charged for their roles in facilitating the
payment of millions of dollars in a bribe to an Indian government official.

The Securities and Exchange Commissionâs complaint alleges that in 2014, a senior government official of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu
demanded a $2 million bribe from the construction firm responsible for building Cognizantâs 2.7 million square foot campus in Chennai, India.
As alleged in the complaint, Cognizantâs President Gordon Coburn and Chief Legal Officer Steven E. Schwartz authorized the contractor to pay
the bribe, and directed their subordinates to conceal the bribe by doctoring the contractorâs change orders. The SEC also alleges that
Cognizant authorized the construction firm to make two additional bribes totaling more than $1.6 million. Cognizant allegedly used sham
change order requests to conceal the payments it made to reimburse the firm.

âBribery to further corporate goals is an illusory path to long-term success. While always the wrong choice, it is particularly egregious when
senior executives chart that course for those they lead, as our complaint alleges here. We are committed to holding them accountable for
their actions,â said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SEC charged Coburn and Schwartz with violating anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the
federal securities laws. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, monetary penalties, and officer-and-director bars against Coburn and
Schwartz.

The SECâs order as to Cognizant found that the company violated Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, which are anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws. Without admitting
or denying the allegations, the company agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of approximately $19 million and a penalty of
$6 million.

The Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey today announced the indictment of Coburn and
Schwartz on criminal charges of violating and conspiring to violate the FCPAâs anti-bribery and accounting provisions.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Michael K. Catoe, Paul W. Sharratt, and M. Shahriar Masud of the FCPA Unit under the supervision
of Robert |. Dodge. The litigation will be led by John Bowers. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section,
the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SEC Brings Settled Charges Against Tyco International
Ltd. Alleging Billion Dollar Accounting Fraud

Company Agrees to Injunction and Payment of $50 Million Penalty

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2006-58

Washington, D.C., April 17, 2006 -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive action in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York against Tyco International
Ltd. The Commission's complaint in that action alleges that, from 1996
through 2002, Tyco violated the federal securities laws by, among other
things, utilizing various improper accounting practices and a scheme involving
transactions with no economic substance to overstate its reported financial
results by at least one billion dollars.

""This enforcement action shows that, in addition to looting the company,
Tyco's Kozlowski-era management lied about the company's financial results,""
said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC's Director of Enforcement. ""Tyco
benefited from this fraud, as the penalty in this case reflects.""

Scott W. Friestad, Associate SEC Enforcement Director, stated, ""The Tyco
accounting fraud was orchestrated at the highest levels of the company, but
carried out at numerous operating units and management levels of the
company. 'Push down' frauds like this are especially difficult to detect and
investigate. Today's enforcement action shows that the Commission and its
staff will pursue such misconduct and take appropriate action.""

The Commission's complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income
by at least $500 million as a result of improper accounting practices related to
some of the many acquisitions that Tyco engaged in during that time. Tyco's
improper acquisition accounting included undervaluing acquired assets,
overvaluing acquired liabilities, and misusing accounting rules concerning the
establishment and utilization of purchase accounting reserves. The complaint
further alleges that, apart from its acquisition activities, Tyco improperly
established and used various kinds of reserves to make adjustments at the
end of reporting periods to enhance and smooth its publicly reported results
and to meet earnings forecasts.

The complaint alleges that Tyco inflated its operating income by $567 million
from its fiscal year 1998 through its fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31, 2002, by
means of connection fees that Tyco's ADT Security Services, Inc. subsidiary
charged to dealers from whom it purchased security monitoring contracts.
Because the connection fee was fully offset by a simultaneous increase in the
purchase price ADT allocated to the dealers' security monitoring contracts,
the connection fee transaction lacked economic substance and should not
have been recorded in Tyco's income statement. In 2003, Tyco restated its
operating income and cash flow relating to the connection fees.

The complaint further alleges that, from September 1996 through early 2002,
Tyco failed to disclose in its proxy statements and annual reports certain
executive compensation, executive indebtedness, and related party
transactions of its former senior management. Tyco also incorrectly
accounted for certain executive bonuses it paid in its fiscal years 2000 and
2001, thereby excluding from its operating expenses the costs associated
with those bonuses. Finally, the complaint alleges that Tyco violated the
antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act when employees or
agents of its Earth Tech Brasil Ltda. subsidiary made payments to Brazilian
officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for Tyco.

Between 1996 and 2002, as a result of these various practices, Tyco made
false and misleading statements or omissions in its filings with the
Commission and its public statements to investors and analysts.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint,
Tyco has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it
from violating the antifraud, proxy disclosure, periodic reporting, corporate
recordkeeping, and antibribery provisions of the federal securities laws. The
proposed final judgment also orders Tyco to pay $1 in disgorgement and a
$50 million civil penalty. The penalty amount, which was provisionally
negotiated in 2005, was reviewed and approved by the Commission in light of
the considerations set forth in ""Statement of the Securities and Exchange
Commission Concerning Financial Penalties,"" Press Release 2006-4 (Jan. 4,
2006).

SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal
Controls Charges Against El Paso Corporation for
Improper Payments to Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food
Program

Company Agrees to Pay $7.7 Million

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-16

Washington, D.C., Feb. 7, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed Foreign Corrupt Practices Act books and records and internal
controls charges against El Paso Corporation, alleging that the NYSE-listed
Texas energy company indirectly paid nearly $5.5 million in illegal surcharges
to Iraq in connection with its purchases of crude oil from third parties under
the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Between June 2001 and June 2002,
El Paso purchased some 21.4 million barrels of Iraqi crude oil under fifteen
contracts from third parties who participated in the Program. The
Commissionâs complaint alleges that 25 to 30 cents per barrel purchased by
El Paso was illegally kicked back to Iraq in the form of a secret oil surcharge
and that El Paso knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that illegal surcharges
were made.

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the Division of Enforcement, said, âThe
Oil for Food kickback scheme in which El Paso participated is especially
troubling because it systematically diverted millions of dollars from a
humanitarian program intended to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people,
and violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

Cheryl Scarboro, an Associate Director in the Division of Enforcement, said,
âThe books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act are important tools to combat illicit kickback schemes. Todayâs
action should emphasize that these activities will not be tolerated.â

Without admitting or denying the Commissionâs allegations, El Paso has
consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and ordering it to pay $5,482,363 in disgorgement of profits and
a civil penalty of $2,250,000. El Paso will satisfy its disgorgement obligation
by forfeiting $5,482,363 pursuant to a non-prosecution agreement with the
U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York.

According to the Commissionâs complaint:

The Oil for Food Program was created to provide humanitarian relief for the
Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade
sanctions imposed against Iraq. However, beginning in August 2000, officials
of Iraqâs State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO), began demanding illegal
kickbacks in the form of surcharges on every barrel of oil sold through the
Program. In September 2000, The Coastal Corporation - which merged with
an El Paso subsidiary in January 2001 - received its first surcharge demand
from a SOMO official. An El Paso consultant and former Coastal official
arranged a $201,877 surcharge payment on the companyâs behalf.

Although El Paso ceased direct purchases from SOMO afterwards, it continued
its purchases through third parties. Between June 2001 and June 2002, El
Paso entered into fourteen third party transactions involving fifteen contracts
to purchase Iraqi oil. The third parties paid some $5.5 million in kickbacks to
acquire the oil. El Paso knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that illegal
surcharges were paid on those contracts and passed back to El Paso in
premiums. Recorded telephone calls of El Paso officials and oil traders
establish El Pasoâs knowledge of the illegal surcharge scheme. El Paso failed
to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and prevent
such payments, and El Paso failed properly to record the nature of the
companyâs payments.

Since being approached by the Commissionâs staff, El Paso has cooperated
with the Commissionâs investigation, which is continuing. The Commission

acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorneyâs Office for the
Southern District of New York and the United Nations Independent Inquiry

Committee.

SEC Charges Diebold With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-225

Washington D.C., Oct. 22, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an Ohio-based manufacturer of ATMs and bank
security systems with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing officials at government-owned banks with pleasure trips in order
to illicitly win business.

The SEC alleges that subsidiaries of Diebold Inc. in China and Indonesia spent approximately $1.8 million on travel, entertainment, and other
improper gifts for senior officials with the ability to influence the banksâ purchasing decisions. Government-owned bank officials in China and
Indonesia were rewarded with free trips to popular tourist destinations in the U.S. and Europe, and Dieboldâs expenditures were falsely
recorded in the companyâs books and records as legitimate training expenses. Dieboldâs subsidiary in China also provided dozens of
government bank officials with annual cash gifts ranging from less than $100 to more than $600. The SEC further alleges that Diebold
falsified books and records to hide approximately $1.2 million of bribes paid to employees at privately owned banks in Russia.

Diebold has agreed to pay more than $48 million to settle the SECâs charges and resolve a parallel criminal matter announced today by the
U.S. Department of Justice.

âA bribe is a bribe, whether itâs a stack of cash or an all-expense-paid trip to Europe,â said Scott W. Friestad, an Associate Director in the
SECâs Division of Enforcement. âPublic companies must be held accountable when they break the law to influence government officials with
improper payments or gifts.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in Washington D.C., Dieboldâs misconduct occurred from 2005 to 2010. Among the
tourist destinations of U.S. trips were the Grand Canyon, Napa Valley, Disneyland, and Universal Studios as well as Las Vegas, New York City,
Chicago, Washington D.C., and Hawaii. Officials also were treated to European vacations. For example, eight officials at a government-
owned bank in China enjoyed a two-week trip at Dieboldâs expense that included stays in Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt,
Munich, Salzburg, Vienna, Klagenfurt, Venice, Florence, and Rome. Destinations of leisure trips for other officials included Australia, New
Zealand, and Bali. In total, Diebold spent approximately $1.6 million to bribe government-owned bank officials in China, and more than
$147,000 to bribe officials at government banks in Indonesia.

The SEC further alleges that from 2005 to 2008, Dieboldâs Russian subsidiary paid approximately $1.2 million in bribes in connection with the
sale of ATMs to private banks in Russia. The bribes were funneled through a distributor in Russia using phony service contracts to hide and
falsely record the payments as legitimate business expenses.

Diebold agreed to pay $22.9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and appoint an independent compliance monitor in order to
settle the SECâs charges. Diebold consented to a final judgment and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)
(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Diebold agreed to pay an additional $25.2 million fine in the parallel criminal
proceeding.

The SECâs investigation was led by Devon A. Brown and Brian O. Quinn with assistance from Jennifer Baskin of the FCPA Unit and Kristen
Dieter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern
District of Ohio, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SEC: Tech Company Bribed Chinese Officials

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-29

Washington D.C., Feb. 16, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Massachusetts-based technology
company and its Chinese subsidiaries agreed to pay more than $28 million to settle parallel civil and criminal actions involving violations of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

An SEC investigation found that two Chinese subsidiaries of PTC Inc. provided non-business related travel and other improper payments to
various Chinese government officials in an effort to win business. PTC agreed to pay $11.858 million in disgorgement and $1.764 million in
prejudgment interest to settle the SECâs charges and its two China subsidiaries agreed to pay a $14.54 million fine in a non-prosecution
agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âPTC failed to stop illicit payments despite indications of potential corruption by agents working with its Chinese subsidiaries, and the
misconduct continued unabated for several years,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SEC also announced its first deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with an individual in an FCPA case. DPAs facilitate and reward
cooperation in SEC investigations by foregoing an enforcement action against an individual who agrees to cooperate fully and truthfully
throughout the period of deferred prosecution. FCPA charges will be deferred for three years against Yu Kai Yuan, a former employee at one
of PTCâs Chinese subsidiaries, as a result of significant cooperation he has provided during the SECâs investigation.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against PTC:
e From at least 2006 to 2011, two PTC China-based subsidiaries provided improper travel, gifts, and entertainment totaling nearly $1.5
million to Chinese government officials who were employed by state-owned entities that were PTC customers.

e PTC gained approximately $11.8 million in profits from sales contracts with state-owned entities whose officials received the improper

e Chinese officials were compensated directly and through third-party agents for sightseeing and tourist activities.

e Third-party agents typically arranged overseas sightseeing trips in conjunction with a visit to a PTC facility, typically the corporate
headquarters in Massachusetts. After one day of business activities, the additional days of sightseeing visits lacked any business

small electronics such as cell phones, iPods, and GPS systems as well as gift cards, wine, and clothing.

e Deferred Prosecution Agreement
",2016-29,--ERROR--,SEC: Tech Company Bribed Chinese Officials.,"Washington D.C., Feb. 16, 2016 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that a Massachusetts-based technology company and its Chinese subsidiaries agreed to pay more than $28 million to settle parallel civil and criminal actions involving violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

An SEC investigation found that two Chinese subsidiaries of PTC Inc. provided non-business related travel and other improper payments to various Chinese government officials in an effort to win business. PTC agreed to pay $11.858 million in disgorgement and $1.764 million in prejudgment interest to settle the SEC’s charges and its two China subsidiaries agreed to pay a $14.54 million fine in a non-prosecution agreement announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

“PTC failed to stop illicit payments despite indications of potential corruption by agents working with its Chinese subsidiaries, and the misconduct continued unabated for several years,” said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit.

The SEC also announced its first deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with an individual in an FCPA case. DPAs facilitate and reward cooperation in SEC investigations by foregoing an enforcement action against an individual who agrees to cooperate fully and truthfully throughout the period of deferred prosecution. FCPA charges will be deferred for three years against Yu Kai Yuan, a former employee at one of PTC’s Chinese subsidiaries, as a result of significant cooperation he has provided during the SEC’s investigation.

According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against PTC: e From at least 2006 to 2011, two PTC China-based subsidiaries provided improper travel, gifts, and entertainment totaling nearly $1.5 million to Chinese government officials who were employed by state-owned entities that were PTC customers.

Officer of Cognizant

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-19446

September 13, 2019 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Sridhar Thiruvengadam, the former chief operating
officer of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, has agreed to settle charges that he violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by
participating in a scheme to bribe an Indian government official.

According to the SEC's order, a senior government official of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu demanded a $2 million bribe from the
construction firm responsible for building Cognizant's 2.7 million square foot campus in Chennai, India. The SEC's order finds that four
Cognizant executives, including Thiruvengadam, met by videoconference to authorize the bribe payment and devise a scheme to cover it up
in the company's books. The SEC order states that Thiruvengadam later helped to conceal the payment by signing false subcertifications to
the management representation letters Cognizant provided to its independent auditor.

The SEC's order finds that Thiruvengadam violated the FCPA's internal accounting controls and recordkeeping provisions. Specifically, the
order finds that he violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 and caused Cognizant's violations of Exchange Act
Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B). Without admitting or denying the findings, Thiruvengadam agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.

In February 2019, Cognizant agreed to settle the SEC's civil claims. The SEC and DO) that same month filed civil and criminal actions in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against two additional Cognizant executives alleging antibribery violations with
respect to the same conduct.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Paul W. Sharratt, Michael K. Catoe, and M. Shahriar Masud of the FCPA Unit, under the supervision
of Robert |. Dodge. The litigation is being led by John Bowers. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Department's Fraud Section,
the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Feb 4, 2016 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that California-based
SciClone Pharmaceuticals has agreed to pay more than $12 million to settle charges that it
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when international subsidiaries increased
sales by making improper payments to health care professionals employed at state health
institutions in China.

An SEC investigation found that employees of SciCloneâs subsidiaries acted as agents of the
company when they gave money, gifts, and other things of value to the health care professionals,
which led to several million dollars in sales of pharmaceutical products to Chinaâs state health
institutions. The schemes, which lasted at least five years, were condoned by various managers
within SciCloneâs China-based subsidiaries. The improper inducements were not accurately
reflected in the companyâs books and records as SciClone failed to devise and maintain a
sufficient system of internal accounting controls and lacked an effective anti-corruption
compliance program.

The SECâs order finds that SciClone violated the FCPAâs anti-bribery, internal controls, and
books-and-records provisions. SciClone consented to the order without admitting or denying the
findings, and agreed to pay $9.426 million in disgorgement of sales profits plus $900,000 in

Medical Device Company Charged With Accounting Failures and
FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2017-18

Washington D.C., Jan. 18, 2017 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Texas-based medical device company
Orthofix International has agreed to admit wrongdoing and pay more than $14 million to settle charges that it improperly booked revenue in
certain instances and made improper payments to doctors at government-owned hospitals in Brazil in order to increase sales.

Four then-executives at Orthofix also agreed to pay penalties to settle cases related to the accounting failures, which according to the SECâs
order involved Orthofix improperly recording certain revenue as soon as a product was shipped despite contingencies requiring certain
events to occur in order to receive payment in the transaction. In other instances, Orthofix immediately recorded revenue when it had
provided customers with significant extensions of time to make payments. The accounting failures caused the company to materially
misstate certain financial statements from at least 2011 to the first quarter of 2013.

âOrthofixâs accounting failures were widespread and significant, causing Orthofix to make false statements to the public about its financial
condition,â said Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SECâs Enforcement Division.

A separate SEC order finds that Orthofix violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiary in Brazil schemed to use high
discounts and make improper payments through third-party commercial representatives and distributors to induce doctors under government
employment to use Orthofixâs products. Fake invoices were used for purported services.

Kara N. Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added, âOrthofix did not have adequate internal controls across all its
subsidiaries and failed to detect and prevent the improper payments in Brazil that were intended to boost sales.â

Orthofix agreed to pay an $8.25 million penalty to resolve the accounting violations and more than $6 million in disgorgement and penalties
to settle the FCPA charges. The company agreed to retain an independent compliance consultant for one year to review and test its FCPA
compliance program. The SECâs order noted Orthofixâs cooperation and remedial acts.

Jeff Hammel, a former accounting executive in Orthofixâs largest business segment, agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty and former sales
executives Kenneth Mack and Bryan McMillan agreed to pay penalties of $40,000 and $25,000 respectively. Hammel also agreed to be
suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits
of public companies. The SECâs order permits Hammel to apply for reinstatement after two years. Orthofixâs former corporate CFO Brian
McCollum agreed to pay a $35,000 penalty and reimburse the company $40,885 for bonuses he received during the period when the
company committed accounting violations. The four consented to the SECâs orders without admitting or denying the findings.

Orthofixâs then-CEO Robert Vaters, who was not charged with wrongdoing, has reimbursed the company $72,886 for cash bonuses and
certain stock awards he received during the period when the company committed accounting violations. Therefore, it wasnât necessary for
the SEC to pursue a Sarbanes-Oxley Section 304(a) clawback action against him.

The SECâs investigation into the accounting violations was conducted by Noel Gittens and Richard Haynes with assistance from Gregory
Bockin. It was supervised by Ricky Sachar and Ms. Chion. The SECâs investigation into the FCPA violations was conducted by Sana Muttalib
and supervised by Ansu N. Banerjee and Ms. Brockmeyer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios in

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Avery Dennison Corporation,
United States District Court for the Central District of California, Civil
Action No. CV09-5493 DSF (CWx)

SEC FILES SETTLED CHARGES AGAINST AVERY DENNISON
CORPORATION FOR VIOLATING THE BOOKS AND RECORDS AND
INTERNAL CONTROLS PROVISIONS OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT
PRACTICES ACT

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed two settled enforcement
proceedings against Avery Dennison Corporation (âAveryâ), a Pasadena,
California-based multinational corporation, alleging violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ) in connection with improper payments and
promises of improper payments to foreign officials by Averyâs Chinese
subsidiary and several entities Avery acquired.

The SEC filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the Central
District of California charging Avery with violations of the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the FCPA and seeking a civil penalty. The
SEC also issued an administrative order finding that Avery violated the same
provisions of the FCPA. In the administrative proceeding, the SEC ordered
Avery to cease and desist from such violations, and to disgorge $273,213,
together with $45,257 in prejudgment interest. In the federal civil action,
Avery agreed to the entry of a final judgment requiring it to pay a civil penalty
in the amount of $200,000.

The SECâs complaint and administrative order charge that, from 2002 through
2005, the Reflectives Division of Avery (China) Co. Ltd. (âAvery Chinaâ) paid
or authorized the payments of kickbacks, sightseeing trips, and gifts to
Chinese government officials. The amount of illegal payments actually paid
amounted to approximately $30,000. In one transaction, Avery China secured
a sale to a state-owned end user by agreeing to pay a Chinese official a
kickback of nearly $25,000 through a distributor. Avery China realized
$273,213 in profit from this transaction, which it inaccurately booked as a
sale to the distributor rather than to the end user. In addition, after Avery
acquired a company in June 2007, employees of the acquired company
continued their pre-acquisition practice of making illegal petty cash payments
to customs or other officials in several foreign countries, resulting in illegal
payments of approximately $51,000. Avery failed to accurately record these
payments and gifts in the companyâs books and records, and failed to
implement or maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
detect and prevent such illegal payments or promises of illegal payments.

As a result of the conduct described above, the SEC charged that Avery
violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Avery consented to the ordered relief without admitting or denying
either the findings contained in the SECâs administrative order, or the
allegations of the SECâs complaint.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the United States Department of
Justice.

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Comverse Technology, Inc.,
Case No. 11-CV-1704-LDW (E.D.N.Y. filed April 7, 2011)

SEC FILES SETTLED FCPA CASE AGAINST COMVERSE

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement
action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against
Comverse Technology, Inc., alleging violations of the books and records and
internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAâ).
Comverse has offered to pay a total of approximately $1.6 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC. Comverseâs proposed
settlement offer has been submitted to the Court for its consideration. Ina
related action, Comverse will pay a $1.2 million criminal fine to the U.S.
Department of Justice.

The SECâs complaint alleges that:

e Between 2003 and 2006, Comverse Limited, an Israeli operating
subsidiary of Comverse, made improper payments to obtain or retain
business. In particular, Comverse Limited made improper payments of
approximately $536,000 to individuals connected to OTE, a
telecommunications provider based in Athens, Greece that is partially
owned by the Greek Government. These payments resulted in contracts
worth approximately $10 million in revenues and ill-gotten gain of
approximately $1.2 million.

e In order to facilitate and conceal the payments, Comverse Limited
employed a third-party agent to establish an offshore entity in Cyprus
which, in turn, funneled the improper payments to Comverse Limitedâs
customers. Comverse Limited employees made payments to the
agentâs offshore entity and, after taking 15% off the top of these
payments, the agent paid the remaining 85% in cash bribes, directly or
indirectly, to Comverse Limitedâs customers.

e These payments were improperly recorded on Comverseâs books and
records as âagent commissions,â and in addition, Comverse failed to
devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances that transactions at all levels of the
organization were properly recorded. For example, neither Comverse
nor Comverse Limited had a process, formal or otherwise, for
conducting due diligence of sales agents or for the independent review
of agent contracts outside the sales departments.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Comverse has consented
to a conduct-based injunction that prohibits Comverse from having books and
records that do not accurately reflect, or from having internal controls that do
not prevent or detect, any illegal payments made to obtain or retain business.
In addition, Comverse consented to pay $1,249,614 in disgorgement and
$358,887 in prejudgment interest.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of DO} in its investigation.

SEC: Qualcomm Hired Relatives of Chinese Officials to Obtain
Business

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-36

Washington D.C., March 1, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Qualcomm Incorporated has agreed to
pay $7.5 million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by hiring relatives of Chinese government officials
deciding whether to select the companyâs mobile technology products amid increasing competition in the international telecommunications
market.

An SEC investigation found that Qualcomm also provided gifts, travel, and entertainment to try to influence officials at government-owned
telecom companies in China. With insufficient internal controls to detect improper payments, Qualcomm misrepresented in its books and
records that the things of value provided to foreign officials were legitimate business expenses.

âCompanies must effectively design and implement internal controls across all business operations to prevent FCPA violations, including its
hiring practices,â said Michele Wein Layne, Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office. âFor more than a decade, Qualcomm went to
extraordinary lengths to gain a business advantage with foreign officials deciding between Qualcommâs technology and its competitors.â

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding:

e Qualcomm offered and provided full-time employment and paid internships to foreign officialsâ family members internally referred to as
âmust placeâ or âspecialâ hires in order to try to obtain or retain business in China.

e One official asked Qualcomm employees to find an internship for her daughter studying in the U.S. and the company obliged,
acknowledging in internal communications that her parents âgave us great help for Q.C. new business development.â

e Another intern was hired by Qualcomm at the request of director general of a Chinese agency. Human resources department e-mails
described the intern as âa MUST PLACEâ and described the hiring as âquite important from a customer relationship perspective.â

e Qualcomm provided a $75,000 research grant to a U.S. university on behalf of the son of a foreign official so he could retain his position
in its Ph.D. program and renew his student visa. Qualcomm also provided him an internship and later permanent employment, and
sent him on a business trip to China (during which he visited his parents over the Chinese New Year) despite concerns expressed about
his qualifications for the assignment.

e The sonâs initial interview for permanent employment resulted in a âno hireâ decision because he was not âa skills matchâ and did not
âmeet the minimum requirements for moving forward with an offer.â Those who interviewed him agreed âhe would be a drain on
teams he would join.â A human resources director still advocated for the hire, writing, âI Know this is a pain, but | think we're operating
under a different paradigm here than a normal âhireâ/âno hireâ decision tree. We're telling this kid ... we donât want to waste time or
extend any extra effort in this favor [the telecom company] has asked of Qualcomm, and then turn around and ask the same person we
just rejected to do us a special favor.â

e Besides the preferential job treatment, a Qualcomm executive personally provided the officialâs son with a $70,000 loan to buy a
home.

e Qualcomm also provided frequent meals, gifts, and entertainment with no valid business purpose to foreign officials to try to influence
their decisions, such as airplane tickets for their children, event tickets and sightseeing for their spouses, and luxury goods.

The SECâs order finds that Qualcomm violated the anti-bribery, internal controls, and books-and-records provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Qualcomm agreed to pay the $7.5 million penalty and self-report to the SEC for the
next two years with annual reports and certifications of its FCPA compliance.

RAE agreed to pay approximately $1.25 million to settle the SEC's charges. In

have adequate measures in place to detect and root out internal wrongdoing,""
said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit.
""Companies that fail to respond to red flags can be held liable for the acts of
their joint venture partners.""

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, the payments â which occurred from 2004 to 2008 â were made
primarily by the direct sales force utilized by RAE at the two joint venture
entities: RAE-KLH (Beijing) Co., Limited (RAE-KLH) and RAE Coal Mine Safety
Instruments (Fushun) Co., Ltd. (RAE-Fushun).

The SEC alleges that RAE-KLH and RAE-Fushun sales personnel typically made
the illicit payments by obtaining cash advances from accounting personnel,
and that RAE did not impose sufficient internal controls or make any
meaningful changes to sales personnel practices. Expenses associated with
these payments were improperly recorded on the books of RAE-KLH and RAE-
Fushun as ""business fees"" or ""travel and entertainment"" expenses. Moreover,
while the payments were made exclusively in China and by Chinese
employees of RAE-KLH and RAE-Fushun, RAE failed to act on red flags
indicating this activity, which allowed, at least in part, the misconduct to
continue at RAE-KLH.

The SEC's complaint charges RAE with violations of the anti-bribery, books
and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. Without admitting
or denying the allegations, RAE consented to the entry of a permanent
injunction against FCPA violations and agreed to pay $1,147,800 in
disgorgement and $109,212 in prejudgment interest. RAE also agreed to
comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program.
The settlement is subject to court approval.

The SEC alleges that the $400,000 in improper payments resulted in contracts worth approximately $3 million in revenue and garnered more than $1.1 million in illicit profits.

RAE agreed to pay approximately $1.25 million to settle the SEC's charges. In a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today that RAE agreed to pay an additional $1.7 million criminal fine.

34-83088-s,"SEC Charges Dun & Bradstreet With FCPA Violations

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-18446

April 23, 2018 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation has agreed to pay more
than $9 million to resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act charges arising from improper payments made by two Chinese subsidiaries.

According to the SECâs order, the two Chinese subsidiaries used third-party agents to make unlawful payments to obtain data vital to Dun &
Bradstreetâs business as a provider of business financial information. One subsidiary, part of a joint venture with a Chinese company,
acquired non-public financial statement information on Chinese entities, in violation of Chinese law, by making unlawful payments to Chinese
government officials. The second subsidiary made improper payments to third parties to acquire non-public personal data in violation of
Chinese law that was used in its products and also made improper payments to obtain specific business. These improper payments were
falsely recorded as legitimate business expenses. Despite concerns raised during pre-acquisition due diligence efforts, Dun & Bradstreet
failed to take appropriate action to stop the improper payments or the false entries into the subsidiaryâs books and records, which continued
for several years post-acquisition.

The SECâs order found that Dun & Bradstreet violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without
admitting or denying the allegations, the company agreed to pay disgorgement of $6,077,820, prejudgment interest of $1,143,664, anda
civil penalty of $2 million.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Michael Catoe, Paul W. Sharratt, and Sonali Singh of the FCPA Unit and supervised by Robert I.
Dodge. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section, the United States Attorneyâs Office for the District of
New Jersey, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SEC SUES THE TITAN CORPORATION FOR PAYMENTS TO
ELECTION CAMPAIGN OF BENIN PRESIDENT

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2005-23

TITAN SETTLES AND AGREES TO PAY A TOTAL OF MORE THAN $28
MILLION TO SETTLE SEC ACTION AND RELATED CRIMINAL ACTION

Titan Pleads Guilty in Related Criminal Action Brought by U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of California and U.S. Department
of Justice, Fraud Section

SEC Also Issues Report of Investigation to Provide Guidance on
Disclosure Concerning Material Provisions in Merger and Other
Contractual Agreements

Washington, D.C., March 1, 2005 - The SEC today announced the filing of
a settled enforcement action charging The Titan Corporation, a San Diego,
Calif. based military intelligence and communications company, with violating
the anti-bribery, internal controls and books and records provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The SEC's complaint alleges, among
other things, that Titan funneled approximately $2 million, via its agent in
Benin, towards the election campaign of Benin's then-incumbent President.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Titan consented to the
entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the
FCPA and requiring it to

Â® pay approximately $15.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment
interest,

e pay a $13 million penalty, which will be deemed satisfied by Titan's
payment of criminal fines of that amount in parallel proceedings
brought by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of
California and the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, and

e retain an independent consultant to review the company's FCPA
compliance and procedures and to adopt and implement the
consultant's recommendations.

""Illicit payments to government officials are inconsistent with fair play and
vigorous competition and are a violation of U.S. law,"" said Stephen M. Cutler,
Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. ""Capital formation and
corporate enterprise thrive when all parties participate on a level playing
field.""

The SEC also issued a Report of Investigation to provide guidance concerning
potential liability under the antifraud and proxy provisions of the federal
securities laws for publication of materially false or misleading disclosures
regarding provisions in merger and other contractual agreements.

""The SEC's Report of Investigation highlights for issuers and disclosure
counsel the potential exposure under the antifraud and proxy laws for
publishing materially inaccurate disclosures relating to merger and other
contractual agreements,"" said Paul R. Berger, Associate Director of
Enforcement.

Summary of the FCPA Enforcement Action
The SEC's complaint against Titan includes the following allegations.

e From 1999 to 2001, Titan paid more than $3.5 million to its agent in
Benin, Africa, who was known at the time by Titan to be the President of
Benin's business advisor. Some of the approximately $2 million
funneled to its agent towards the election campaign of Benin's then-
incumbent President was used to reimburse Titan's agent for the
purchase of T-shirts adorned with the President's picture and
instructions to vote for him in the upcoming election. Titan made these
payments to assist the company in its development of a
telecommunications project in Benin and to obtain the Benin
government's consent to an increase in the percentage of Titan's
project management fees for that project. A former senior Titan officer
directed that these payments be falsely invoiced by the agent as
consulting services and that actual payment of the money be broken
into smaller increments and spread out over time. The complaint does
not allege that the then-incumbent President knew of the payments.
e In addition, despite utilizing over 120 agents and consultants in over 60
countries, Titan never had a formal company-wide FCPA policy,
disregarded or circumvented the limited FCPA policies and procedures
in effect, failed to maintain sufficient due diligence files on its foreign
agents, and failed to have meaningful oversight over its foreign agents.

e Titan also

Â° falsified documents that enabled Titan's agents to under-report
local commission payments in Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka;

e falsified documents presented to the United States government
by under-reporting commission payments on equipment exported
to Sri Lanka, France and Japan;

Â© paid a World Bank Group analyst in cash to assist it in its project
in Benin; and

Â© paid a Benin government official approximately $14,000 in travel
expenses from 1999 to 2001.

Summary of SEC's Report Pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange
Act

e On Sept. 15, 2003, Titan became a party to a merger agreement in
which Lockheed Martin Corporation agreed to acquire Titan, pending
certain contingencies. Titan affirmatively represented in that merger
agreement that to the knowledge of Titan, neither the company ""nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any director, officer, agent or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has ... taken any action which
would cause the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be in violation of
the FCPA."" This representation was publicly disclosed and disseminated
by Titan in two places. The proxy statement disclosed the nature of the
representation. The merger agreement containing the representation
was also appended to Titan's proxy statement.

e As the Report highlights, when an issuer makes a public disclosure of
information -- via filing a proxy statement or otherwise -- the issuer is
required to consider whether additional disclosure is necessary in order
to put the information contained in, or otherwise incorporated into that
publication, into context so that such information is not misleading. The
issuer cannot avoid this disclosure obligation simply because the
information published was contained in an agreement or other
document not prepared as a disclosure document.

e The Report is not intended to change the way issuers engage in merger,
or other contractual, negotiations or to alter existing diligence
obligations or to suggest, absent special circumstances (such as
provisions intended to create third party beneficiaries), that provisions
such as representations and covenants in such agreements are binding
on or intended to benefit persons other than parties thereto.
Representations, covenants, or other provisions of an agreement made
by an issuer that are not public or disclosed to shareholders are not
covered by the scope of this Report.

e The SEC will consider bringing an enforcement action in the future if it
determines that the subject matter of representations or other
contractual provisions is materially misleading to shareholders because
material facts necessary to make that disclosure not misleading are
omitted.

Today the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California and the
U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section filed criminal FCPA charges and a
tax charge against Titan, who entered a guilty plea before the Honorable
Roger T. Benitez, United States District Judge for the Southern District of
California (United States of America v. Titan Corporation, Case No.05cr0314-
BEN (S.D. Cal.)). In particular, Titan agreed to plead guilty to one felony count
of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one felony count for
falsifying the books and records of Titan, and one felony count for violating
Title 26 U.S.C. Section 7206(2) and to pay a criminal fine of $13 million.

SEC Charges Archer-Daniels-Midland Company With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-271

Washington D.C., Dec. 20, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland
Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

An SEC investigation found that ADMâs subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the
release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records
as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made
approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries.

ADM, which is based in Decatur, Ill., has agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SECâs charges. In a parallel action, the U.S.
Department of Justice today announced a non-prosecution agreement with ADM and criminal charges against an ADM subsidiary that has
agreed to pay $17.8 million in criminal fines.

âADMâs lackluster anti-bribery controls enabled its subsidiaries to get preferential refund treatment by paying off foreign government
officials,â said Gerald Hodgkins, an associate director in the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âCompanies with worldwide operations must
ensure their compliance is vigilant across the globe and their transactions are recorded truthfully.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine
imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT
already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not
make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADMâs Ukraine affiliate reached as
high as $46 million.

The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADMâs subsidiaries in Germany and
Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20
percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping
company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an
insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for
several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine.

The SECâs complaint charges ADM with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ADM consented
to the entry of a final judgment ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $33,342,012 plus prejudgment interest of $3,125,354. The
final judgment also permanently enjoins ADM from violating those sections of the Exchange Act, and requires the company to report on its
FCPA compliance efforts for a three-year period. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC took into account ADMâs cooperation
and significant remedial measures, including self-reporting the matter, implementing a comprehensive new compliance program throughout
its operations, and terminating employees involved in the misconduct.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Nicholas A. Brady and supervised by Moira T. Roberts and Anita B. Bandy. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SEC Charges Baker Hughes With Foreign Bribery and
With Violating 2001 Commission Cease-and-Desist Order

Baker Hughes Subsidiary Pleads Guilty to Three Felony Charges in
Criminal Action Filed by Department of Justice; Criminal Fines, Civil
Penalties and Disgorgement of Illicit Profits Total More Than $44
Million

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2007-77

Washington, D.C., April 26, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced the filing of a settled enforcement action charging Baker
Hughes Incorporated, a Houston, Texas-based global provider of oil field
products and services, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA). Baker Hughes has agreed to pay more than $23 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest for these violations and to pay a civil
penalty of $10 million for violating a 2001 Commission cease-and-desist Order
prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions
of the FCPA.

In the same complaint, the SEC also charged Roy Fearnley, a former business
development manager for Baker Hughes, with violating and aiding and
abetting violations of the FCPA. Fearnley has not reached any settlement with
the Commission regarding these charges.

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said,
""Baker Hughes committed widespread and egregious violations of the FCPA
while subject to a prior Commission cease-and-desist Order. The $10 million
penalty demonstrates that companies must adhere to Commission Orders and
that recidivists will be punished.""

Christopher R. Conte, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of
Enforcement, added, ""Companies like Baker Hughes will be held accountable
when they circumvent the rules of fair play and honest competition by making
improper payments to win business.""

The SEC's complaint alleges that Baker Hughes paid approximately $5.2
million to two agents while knowing that some or all of the money was
intended to bribe government officials, specifically officials of State-owned
companies, in Kazakhstan. The complaint alleges that one agent was hired in
September 2000 on the understanding that Kazakhoil, Kazakhstan's national
oil company at that time, had demanded that the agent be hired to influence
senior level employees of Kazakhoil to approve the award of business to the
company. Baker Hughes retained the agent principally at the urging of
Fearnley. According to the complaint, Fearnley told his bosses that the ""agent
for Kazakhoil"" told him that unless the agent was retained, Baker Hughes
could ""say goodbye to this and future business."" Baker Hughes engaged the
agent and was awarded an oil services contract in the Karachaganak oil field
in Kazakhstan that generated more than $219 million in gross revenues from
2001 through 2006. Baker Hughes, the complaint alleges, paid the agent $4.1
million to its bank account in London but received no identifiable services
from the agent. The complaint also alleges that in 1998 Baker Hughes
retained a second agent in connection with the award of a large chemical
contract with KazTransOil, the national oil transportation operator of
Kazakhstan. Between 1998 and 1999, Baker Hughes paid over $1 million to
the agent's Swiss bank account, despite a company employee knowing by
December 1998 that the agent's representative was a high-ranking executive
of KazTransOil.

The SEC's complaint against Baker Hughes also alleges violations of the books
and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in Nigeria, Angola,
Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. In addition to violating the
FCPA, certain of this conduct occurred after September 12, 2001, and
consequently violated the Commission's 2001 cease-and-desist Order.
Specifically, the complaint alleges that between 1998 and 2005, Baker
Hughes made payments in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and
Kazakhstan in circumstances that reflected a failure to implement sufficient
internal controls to determine whether the payments were for legitimate
services, whether the payments would be shared with government officials, or
whether these payments would be accurately recorded in Baker Hughes'
books and records.

For example, the complaint alleges that

e from 1998 to 2004, Baker Hughes authorized commission payments of
nearly $5.3 million to an agent (who worked in Kazakhstan, Russia and
Uzbekistan) under circumstances in which the company failed to
determine whether such payments were, in part, to be funneled to
government officials in violation of the FCPA;

e in Indonesia, between 2000 and 2003, Baker Hughes paid certain
freight forwarders to import equipment into Indonesia using a ""door-to-
door"" process under circumstances in which the company failed to
adequately assure itself that such payments were not being passed on,
in part, to Indonesian customs officials;

e in Nigeria, between at least 2001 and 2005, Baker Hughes authorized
payments to certain customs brokers to facilitate the resolution of
alleged customs deficiencies under circumstances in which the
company failed to adequately assure itself that such payments were not
being passed on, in part, to Nigerian customs officials; and

e in Angola, from 1998 to 2003, Baker Hughes paid an agent more than
$10.3 million in commissions under circumstances in which the
company failed to adequately assure itself that such payments were not
being passed on to employees of Sonangol, Angola's state-owned oil
company, to obtain or retain business in Angola.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Baker Hughes consented
to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations
of the FCPA and ordering it to pay a civil penalty and disgorgement with
prejudgment interest; and to retain an independent consultant to review the
company's FCPA policies and procedures.

The Commission acknowledges Baker Hughes' cooperation in the
investigation.

In a related criminal proceeding announced today, the United States
Department of Justice filed criminal FCPA charges against Baker Hughes and
its wholly-owned subsidiary Baker Hughes Services International, Inc., with an
office in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. Baker Hughes Services International, Inc.
entered a guilty plea before the Honorable Gray H. Miller, United States
District Judge for the Southern District of Texas, and agreed to plead guilty to
one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, one count of
aiding and abetting the falsification of the books and records of Baker
Hughes, and one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and to pay a
criminal fine of $11 million. The Department of Justice has also entered into
an agreement with Baker Hughes to defer prosecution for two years on
charges of violating the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the
FCPA. Under the agreement, the company will retain for a period of three
years a monitor to review and assess the company's compliance program and
monitor its implementation of and compliance with new internal policies and
procedures.

provided, in the form of mutual legal assistance, by the Isle of Man Financial
Supervision Commission, HM Procureur (Attorney General) for Guernsey, and

Penalties and Disgorgement of Illicit Profits Total More Than $44. Million.","Washington, D.C., April 26, 2007 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the filing of a settled enforcement action charging Baker Hughes Incorporated, a Houston, Texas-based global provider of oil field products and services, with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Baker Hughes has agreed to pay more than $23 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for these violations and to pay a civil penalty of $10 million for violating a 2001 Commission cease-and-desist Order prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.

In the same complaint, the SEC also charged Roy Fearnley, a former business development manager for Baker Hughes, with violating and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA. Fearnley has not reached any settlement with the Commission regarding these charges.

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said, ""Baker Hughes committed widespread and egregious violations of the FCPA while subject to a prior Commission cease-and-desist Order. The $10 million penalty demonstrates that companies must adhere to Commission Orders and that recidivists will be punished.""
Christopher R. Conte, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement, added, ""Companies like Baker Hughes will be held accountable when they circumvent the rules of fair play and honest competition by making improper payments to win business.""
The SEC's complaint alleges that Baker Hughes paid approximately $5.2 million to two agents while knowing that some or all of the money was intended to bribe government officials, specifically officials of State-owned companies, in Kazakhstan. The complaint alleges that one agent was hired in September 2000 on the understanding that Kazakhoil, Kazakhstan's national oil company at that time, had demanded that the agent be hired to influence senior level employees of Kazakhoil to approve the award of business to the company. Baker Hughes retained the agent principally at the urging of Fearnley. According to the complaint, Fearnley told his bosses that the ""agent for Kazakhoil"" told him that unless the agent was retained, Baker Hughes could ""say goodbye to this and future business."" Baker Hughes engaged the agent and was awarded an oil services contract in the Karachaganak oil field in Kazakhstan that generated more than $219 million in gross revenues from 2001 through 2006.

SEC Charges KBR and Halliburton for FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2009-23

Washington, D.C., Feb. 11, 2009 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced settlements with KBR, Inc. and Halliburton Co. to resolve
SEC charges that KBR subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root LLC bribed Nigerian
government officials over a 10-year period, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), in order to obtain construction contracts. The SEC also
charged that KBR and Halliburton, KBR's former parent company, engaged in
books and records violations and internal controls violations related to the
bribery.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 20897A
Â®Â» SEC Complaint

 

KBR and Halliburton have agreed to pay $177 million in disgorgement to
settle the SEC's charges. Kellogg Brown & Root LLC has agreed to pay a $402
million fine to settle parallel criminal charges brought today by the U.S.
Department of Justice. The sanctions represent the largest combined
settlement ever paid by U.S. companies since the FCPA's inception.

""FCPA violations have been and will continue to be dealt with severely by the
SEC and other law enforcement agencies,"" said SEC Chairman Mary L.
Schapiro. ""Any company that seeks to put greed ahead of the law by making
illegal payments to win business should beware that we are working
vigorously across borders to detect and punish such illicit conduct.""

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said,
""This case demonstrates the close and cooperative working relationships that
have developed in FCPA investigations among the SEC, the U.S. Department
of Justice, and foreign law enforcement agencies and securities regulators.""

Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement,
added, ""The SEC will not tolerate violations of the FCPA, regardless of the
lengths to which public companies will go to structure their corrupt
transactions to avoid detection. Multi-national companies should take heed
that attempting to conceal bribes by funneling them through intermediaries
or offshore entities will not be successful.""

Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division at
the Department of Justice said, ""Today's guilty plea by KBR ends one chapter
in the Department's long-running investigation of corruption in the award of
$6 billion in construction contracts in Nigeria. This bribery scheme involved
both senior foreign government officials and KBR corporate executives who
took actions to insulate themselves from the reach of U.S. law enforcement.
The successful prosecution of KBR, and its agreement to pay a more than
$400 million fine, demonstrates that no one is above the law, and that the
Department is determined to seek penalties that are commensurate with, and
will deter, this kind of serious criminal misconduct.""

Kellogg Brown & Root LLC's predecessor entities (Kellogg, Brown & Root, Inc.
and The M.W. Kellogg Company) were members of a four-company joint
venture that won the construction contracts worth more than $6 billion. In
September 1998, Halliburton acquired Dresser Industries, Inc., the parent
company of The M.W. Kellogg Company.

The SEC alleges that beginning as early as 1994, members of the joint
venture determined that it was necessary to pay bribes to officials within the
Nigerian government in order to obtain the construction contracts. The former
CEO of the predecessor entities, Albert ""Jack"" Stanley, and others involved in
the joint venture met with high-ranking Nigerian government officials and
their representatives on at least four occasions to arrange the bribe
payments. To conceal the illicit payments, the joint venture entered into sham
contracts with two agents, one based in the United Kingdom and one based in
Japan, to funnel money to Nigerian officials.

The SEC's complaint alleges that the internal controls of Halliburton, the
parent company of the KBR predecessor entities from 1998 to 2006, failed to
detect or prevent the bribery, and that Halliburton records were falsified as a
result of the bribery scheme. In September 2008, Stanley pleaded guilty to
bribery and related charges and entered into a settlement with the SEC.

The SEC alleges that officials of the joint venture formed a ""cultural
committee"" to decide how to carry out the bribery scheme. The committee
decided to use the United Kingdom agent to make payments to high-ranking
Nigerian officials and to use the Japanese agent to make payments to lower-
ranking Nigerian officials. As the joint venture was paid for work on the
construction project, the joint venture in turn made payments to the Japanese
agent and to the Swiss and Monaco bank accounts of the United Kingdom
agent. The total payments to the two agents exceeded $180 million. After
receiving the money, the United Kingdom agent made substantial payments
to accounts controlled by Nigerian government officials, and beginning in
2002 paid $5 million in cash to a Nigerian political party.

The SEC's complaint further alleges that, after the Dresser acquisition,
Halliburton failed to devise and maintain adequate internal controls to govern
the use of foreign sales agents and failed to maintain and enforce the internal
controls it had. Halliburton's due diligence investigation of the United
Kingdom agent failed to detect or prevent the bribery scheme. Halliburton
conducted no due diligence on the Japanese agent. As a result of the scheme,
numerous Halliburton records contained false information relating to the
payments to the agents.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, KBR and Halliburton have
consented to the entry of a court order that (i) permanently enjoins KBR from
violating the anti-bribery and records falsification provisions in Sections 30A,
13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and from
aiding and abetting violations of the record-keeping and internal control
provisions in Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; (ii)
permanently enjoins Halliburton from violating the record-keeping and
internal control provisions of the Exchange Act; (iii) orders the companies to
disgorge $177 million in ill-gotten profits derived from the scheme; (iv)
imposes an independent monitor for KBR for a period of three years to review
its FCPA compliance program, and (v) imposes an independent consultant for
Halliburton to review its policies and procedures as they relate to compliance
with the FCPA. The proposed settlements are subject to the court's approval.

In the related criminal proceeding announced today, the U.S. Department of
Justice filed a criminal action against Kellogg Brown & Root LLC, charging one
count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and four counts of violating the anti-
bribery provisions of the FCPA. Kellogg Brown & Root LLC has pled guilty to
each of these counts. Under its plea agreement, Kellogg Brown & Root LLC is
required to pay a criminal fine of $402 million and to retain a monitor to
review and evaluate KBR's policies and procedures as they relate to
compliance with the FCPA.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of
Justice, Fraud Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and foreign
authorities in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Commission's
investigation is continuing.

SEC Charges Armor Holdings, Inc. With FCPA Violations
in Connection With Sales to the United Nations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-146

Washington, D.C., July 13, 2011 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Armor Holdings, Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) by participating in a bribery scheme from 2001 through 2006 to obtain
contracts to supply body armor for use in United Nations (U.N.) peacekeeping
missions. The SEC also charged Armor Holdings, a Florida-based manufacturer
of military and law enforcement safety equipment, with failing to properly
account for more than $4 million in commissions from 2001 through 2007 in
violation of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
federal securities laws.

 

Additional Materials

Â®Â» SEC Complaint
Â® Litigation Release No. 22037

 

Armor Holdings agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying nearly $5.7
million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalties. Armor Holdings
also agreed to pay a $10.29 million fine to settle a parallel criminal
investigation announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today. Since 2010,
the SEC has filed 32 FCPA cases, including the case against Armor Holdings,
and obtained more than $600 million in penalties, disgorgement and interest.

âIllicit payments to U.N. officials are no less reprehensible than bribes to
foreign government officials,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs
Division of Enforcement. âThe important process of selecting body armor for
peace keepers should not be affected by which company pays the best
bribes.â

Gerald W. Hodgkins, Associate Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement,
added, âArmor failed to maintain adequate internal controls to prevent its
subsidiary from making illegal payments to win U.N. supply contracts. Just as
troubling, Armor improperly accounted for sales commissions for several
years even after being warned that the accounting treatment was wrong.â

The SECâs complaint alleges that certain agents of Armor Holdings caused its
U.K. subsidiary to wire at least 92 payments, totaling approximately $222,750
to a third-party intermediary, with the understanding that part of these
payments would be offered to a U.N. official who could help steer business to
Armor Holdingsâ U.K. subsidiary. The complaint alleges that agents of Armor
Holdings caused its U.K. subsidiary to enter into a sham consulting agreement
with the intermediary for purportedly providing legitimate services in
connection with the sale of goods to the U.N. The complaint alleges that,
through this bribery scheme, Armor Holdings derived gross revenues of
$7,121,237, and net profits of $1,552,306.

The SEC alleges that another Armor Holdings subsidiary disguised in its books
and records commissions paid to intermediaries who brokered the sale of
goods to foreign governments. Even after being warned by internal and
external accountants that this practice violated U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, Armor Holdingsâ subsidiary continued the improper
accounting practice. As a result, approximately $4 million in commissions was
not properly disclosed in the books and records of the company.

On July 31, 2007, after the conduct alleged in the SECâs complaint had
occurred, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems, Inc., an indirect
wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Britainâs BAE Systems PLC. Accordingly,
Armor Holdings is no longer an issuer of securities.

The SECâs complaint charges Armor Holdings with violating Sections 30A,
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without
admitting or denying the allegations, Armor Holdings consented to the entry
of a permanent injunction against further violations and agreed to pay
$1,552,306 in disgorgement, $458,438 in prejudgment interest, and a civil
money penalty of $3,680,000. Armor Holdings also agreed to comply with
certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. The settlement
is subject to court approval. Armor Holdings conducted a thorough
investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and
cooperated with the SECâs inquiry.

Richard J. Kutchey and Gregory G. Faragasso conducted the SECâs
investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud
Section of DOJâs Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
SECâs investigation is continuing.

Armor Holdings also agreed to pay a $10.29 million fine to settle a parallel criminal investigation announced by the U.S. Department of Justice today. Since 2010, the SEC has filed 32 FCPA cases, including the case against Armor Holdings, and obtained more than $600 million in penalties, disgorgement and interest.

“Illicit payments to U.N. officials are no less reprehensible than bribes to foreign government officials,” said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “The important process of selecting body armor for peace keepers should not be affected by which company pays the best bribes.”
Gerald W. Hodgkins, Associate Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, added, “Armor failed to maintain adequate internal controls to prevent its subsidiary from making illegal payments to win U.N. supply contracts. Just as troubling, Armor improperly accounted for sales commissions for several years even after being warned that the accounting treatment was wrong.”
The SEC’s complaint alleges that certain agents of Armor Holdings caused its U.K. subsidiary to wire at least 92 payments, totaling approximately $222,750 to a third-party intermediary, with the understanding that part of these payments would be offered to a U.N. official who could help steer business to Armor Holdings’ U.K. subsidiary. The complaint alleges that agents of Armor Holdings caused its U.K. subsidiary to enter into a sham consulting agreement with the intermediary for purportedly providing legitimate services in connection with the sale of goods to the U.N. The complaint alleges that, through this bribery scheme, Armor Holdings derived gross revenues of $7,121,237, and net profits of $1,552,306.

The SEC alleges that another Armor Holdings subsidiary disguised in its books and records commissions paid to intermediaries who brokered the sale of goods to foreign governments. Even after being warned by internal and external accountants that this practice violated U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Armor Holdings’ subsidiary continued the improper accounting practice. As a result, approximately $4 million in commissions was not properly disclosed in the books and records of the company.

On July 31, 2007, after the conduct alleged in the SEC’s complaint had occurred, Armor Holdings was acquired by BAE Systems, Inc., an indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Britain’s BAE Systems PLC. Accordingly, Armor Holdings is no longer an issuer of securities.

The SEC’s complaint charges Armor Holdings with violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Armor Holdings consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against further violations and agreed to pay $1,552,306 in disgorgement, $458,438 in prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty of $3,680,000. Armor Holdings also agreed to comply with certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. The settlement is subject to court approval. Armor Holdings conducted a thorough investigation to determine the scope of the improper payments and cooperated with the SEC’s inquiry.

Richard J. Kutchey and Gregory G. Faragasso conducted the SEC’s investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of DOJ’s Criminal Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The
SEC’s investigation is continuing.

ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING ENFORCEMENT
RELEASE NO. 859 / November 21, 1996

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. MONTEDISON, S.p.A,
Defendant, Civil Action No. 1:96CV02631 (HHG) (D.D.C. November
21, 1996)

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that
it filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia charging Montedison, S.p.A.
(""Montedison"") with committing financial fraud by falsifying
documents to inflate artificially the company's financial
statements. The Commission's complaint also charges Montedison
with violating the corporate reporting, books and records, and
internal control provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (""Exchange Act"").

Montedison, an Italian corporation with headquarters in
Milan, has interests in the agro-industry, chemical, energy and
engineering sectors. Since July 1987, American Depositary
Receipts (""ADRs""), each representing ten shares of the company's
common stock, have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The ADRs are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act,
and the company files reports with the Commission in Washington,
D.C. pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. The company
files annual reports with the Commission on Form 20-F.

The Commission's complaint alleges that Montedison violated
the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act by engaging in a
fraudulent scheme to materially misstate its financial condition
and results of operations on its books and records and in its
reports filed with the Commission and disseminated to the
investing public. This fraudulent scheme continued from at least
1988 through the first half of 1993. The complaint alleges that
the scheme was designed to conceal hundreds of millions of
dollars of payments that, among other things, were used to bribe
politicians in Italy and other persons. The scheme concealed
losses of at least $398 million. The complaint alleges that as a
result of the scheme, Montedison's assets were materially
overstated on its books and records and in its financial
statements for its 1988, 1989, 1990 and 1991 fiscal years.

The complaint alleges two examples of Montedison's
fraudulent conduct: the ""Exilar Loan"" and the ""ENIMONT Affair.""
According to the complaint, the Exilar Loan was a fraudulent
accounting entry used to disguise and aggregate as an asset on
the company's balance sheet numerous questionable payments or
START OF PAGE 2======

 

bribes that had been made from at least December 1988 through May
1993. In the latter half of 1993, Montedison determined that the
Exilar Loan was uncollectable, and took a write-down in the
amount of 435 billion lire (approximately $272 million, at $1 =
1,600 lire) for the company's 1992 fiscal year. The complaint
alleges that The ENIMONT Affair involved fraudulent accounting
entries involving overstated real estate values to disguise
numerous bribes on the company's books and records from at least
1990 through 1992. The fraudulent entries resulted in a write-
down on the company's 1993 financial statements of 202 billion
lire (approximately $126,250,000).

In its complaint, the Commission requests that the court:
(i) enter findings that Montedison violated Exchange Act Sections
10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20
and 13a-1 thereunder; (ii) grant a permanent injunction
restraining and enjoining Montedison from violating such
provisions; and (iii) order Montedison to pay a civil penalty
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 21(d) (3).

SEC v. JOSHUA C. CANTOR, Civil Action No. 03 CV 2488 (LMM)
(S.D.N.Y. April 10, 2003)

SEC FILES SETTLED FINANCIAL FRAUD
AND FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT ACTION AGAINST
JOSHUA C. CANTOR, FORMER OFFICER OF AMERICAN BANKNOTE
CORPORATION AND AMERICAN BANK NOTE HOLOGRAPHICS, INC.

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled civil injunctive
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
against Joshua C. Cantor, a former president and director of American Bank
Note Holographics, Inc. (""ABNH""), and a former executive vice president of
ABNH's parent, American Banknote Corporation (""ABN"").

The Complaint against Cantor alleges that, from fiscal year 1996 through
fiscal year 1998, Cantor participated in a systematic fraudulent scheme to
inflate the revenues and net income of ABN and ABNH, in order to meet
earnings forecasts and to condition the market for an initial public offering of
stock by ABNH. During the period of the alleged fraud, ABN was a publicly
held holding company located in New York, New York, which, through its
subsidiaries, provided, among other things, stored-value telephone cards,
magnetic-strip transaction cards, printed business forms, and checks. ABNH,
located in Elmsford, New York, was, during the same period, engaged in the
origination, production, and marketing of mass-produced secure holograms.
ABNH was a wholly owned subsidiary of ABN until its initial public offering in
July 1998.

The Complaint alleges that:

e During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1996, Cantor caused
ABNH improperly to recognize revenue totaling approximately $645,000
on consignment sales. In addition, on or about January 30, 1997, Cantor
caused ABNH to accrue approximately $635,000 in revenue for fiscal
year 1996 on two fraudulent ""bill and hold"" sales and caused ABNH to
accrue $800,000 in fraudulent revenue for research and development
(""R&D"") work.

e To convince ABN's auditors that the 1996 fiscal year end ""bill and hold""
and R&D transactions were proper, Cantor secured false audit
confirmations from the customers.

e In fiscal year 1997, Cantor caused ABNH improperly to recognize
revenue of over $1.8 million on consignment sales and to recognize
improperly revenue of approximately $1.3 million on a December 31,
1997 shipment of unusable work in process.

e In addition, in December 1997, Cantor caused ABNH to fraudulently
recognize approximately $6 million in revenue on a ""bill and hold"" sale
when the holograms sold had not actually been completed by the
subcontractor by December 31, 1997. Thereafter, in connection with
ABN's fiscal year 1997 audit, Cantor misled ABN's auditors into
believing that the holograms produced by the subcontractor were
completed, and delivered to ABNH's facility, by December 31, 1997.

e Cantor also obtained false audit confirmations from other customers
which were given to ABN's auditors to conceal fraudulent fiscal year
1997 sales. Also, during the audit, Cantor provided to ABN's auditors a
management representation letter that was false and misleading.

e In fiscal year 1998, Cantor caused ABNH fraudulently to recognize
approximately $26 million in revenue through consignment sales,
shipments to warehouses, and sales of product that was never shipped,
that was returned, and that was test material. In addition, in late 1998,
Cantor violated the anti-bribery provisions of the federal securities laws
by causing ABNH to pay $239,000 to a Swiss bank account for the
purpose of influencing or affecting the acts or decisions of one or more
Saudi Arabian officials, or the Saudi Arabian government, to assist
ABNH in obtaining or retaining business with that government.

Cantor, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's
Complaint, consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating
and/or aiding and abetting violations of the antifraud, reporting, record
keeping, internal controls, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal
securities laws, as well as from violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act --
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A)
and (B), 13(b)(5), and Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(""Exchange Act""), and Exchange Act Rules 10b-5, 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-13,
13b2-1, and 13b2-2. In addition, Cantor consented to a ten year prohibition
from acting as an officer or director of a public company.

This is a refiling of earlier charges against Cantor. The Commission had earlier
named Cantor as a defendant in a civil injunctive action, (see Litigation
Release No. 170684, July 18, 2001), that was voluntarily dismissed without
prejudice on November 15, 2001.

The Commission's investigation that led to this action was conducted in
cooperation with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District
of New York.

PURSUANT TO SECTION 21C THE

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934,

MACHINES CORPORATION, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A

CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER
Respondent.

 

 

 

 

The Securities and Exchange Commission (""Commission"") deems it
appropriate that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are,
instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(""Exchange Act"") against International Business Machines Corporation (""IBM"").

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, IBM has submitted an
Offer of Settlement (""Offer"") that the Commission has determined to accept.
As set forth in the Offer, IBM admits the jurisdiction of the Commission over it
and over the subject matter of this proceeding. Solely for the purpose of this
proceeding and any other proceeding brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and prior to a hearing and
without admitting or denying the findings contained herein, IBM consents to
the entry of this Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-
Desist Order (""Order""). The Commission has determined that it is appropriate
to accept the Offer from IBM, and accordingly is issuing this Order.

Hl.
FINDINGS

Based on the foregoing, the Commission finds that:

A. Respondent

International Business Machines Corporation is a New York corporation with its
headquarters in Armonk, New York. The common stock of IBM is registered
with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is
listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

B. Other Relevant Entities and Persons

IBM-Argentina, S.A. (""IBM-Argentina"") is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary
of IBM with its headquarters in Buenos Aires, Argentina. IBM-Argentina reports
to IBM through the Latin America division of IBM-World Trade Corporation,
which division is now headquartered in Miami, Florida.

Banco de la Nacion Argentina (""BNA"") is a government-owned commercial
bank in Argentina. BNA entered into a $250 million systems integration
contract with IBM-Argentina in 1994 (the ""Contract"").

Capacitacion Y Computacion Rural, S.A. (""CCR"") is an Argentine corporation
that was a subcontractor to IBM-Argentina on the BNA Contract.

Gustavo Soriani (""Soriani"") was IBM-Argentina's Vice President of Operations
until his termination in September 1995. He resides in Argentina and is a
citizen of that country.

Ricardo Martorana (""Martorana"") was IBM-Argentina's General Manager until
his resignation in September 1995. He resides in Argentina and is a citizen of
that country.

Javier Orcoyen (""Orcoyen"") was IBM-Argentina's Vice President of Finance
until his resignation in September 1995. He resides in Argentina and is a
citizen of that country.

Soriani, Martorana and Orcoyen were, at the time of their departure, the three
highest ranking officials at IBM-Argentina and are referred to herein
collectively as ""IBM-Argentina's Former Senior Management.""

C. Facts

This matter involves violations of the books and records provisions of the
Exchange Act, arising out of presumed illicit payments to foreign officials
during 1994. As described below, in connection with the Contract, IBM-
Argentina's Former Senior Management caused IBM-Argentina to enter into a
subcontract with CCR (the ""Subcontract""), and money paid to CCR by IBM-
Argentina in connection with the Subcontract was apparently subsequently
paid by CCR to certain BNA officials.

In January 1994, IBM-Argentina submitted a proposal to BNA for a system to
modernize and fully integrate the computers in its main and branch offices. In
February 1994, BNA awarded the Contract to IBM-Argentina. The Contract was
one of IBM-Argentina's largest contracts. Without the knowledge or approval
of any IBM employee in the United States, IBM-Argentina's Former Senior
Management caused IBM-Argentina to enter into the Subcontract with ccr.t
During 1994 and 1995, IBM-Argentina paid CCR approximately $22 million
under the Subcontract, of which at least $4.5 million was transferred to
several BNA directors by CCR.

In connection with the Subcontract, IBM-Argentina's Former Senior
Management overrode IBM procurement and contracting procedures, and hid
the details of the Subcontract from the technical and financial review
personnel assigned to the Contract. Although IBM's procurement procedures
specified that a Procurement department employee should have performed

and documented certain reviews in connection with the Subcontract,4 those
procedures were overridden by IBM-Argentina's Former Senior Management
by providing the Procurement department with fabricated documentation,
including a backdated authorization letter and a document that stated
incomplete and inaccurate reasons for hiring CCR. IBM-Argentina's Former
Senior Management were able to bypass IBM-Argentina's established
procurement review procedures and caused the issuance of a purchase order
for CCR's services. Based on these documents, IBM-Argentina paid CCR
approximately $22 million.

IBM-Argentina recorded the payments to CCR in its books and records as
third-party subcontractor expenses. While IBM did not falsify or destroy any
records, in consolidating its subsidiaries' financial results, and without the
knowledge or approval of any employee in the United States, this information
was incorporated into IBM's 1994 Form 10-K, which was filed with the
Commission on March 23, 1995.

After IBM officials learned that its policies and procedures had been
circumvented by IBM-Argentina's Former Senior Management, the company
took immediate corrective action. Among other things, Soriani was terminated
from his position at IBM-Argentina, Martorana and Orcoyen were asked to,
and did, resign from their positions at IBM-Argentina, and all future payments
to CCR under the Subcontract were stopped. IBM also enhanced its internal
controls with respect to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") compliance
issues. This Order and the complaint filed contemporaneously herewith relate
to events that occurred in 1994 and 1995, and not the current practices of
IBM.

IV.
LEGAL DI ION

Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, the ""books and records"" provisions of
the FCPA, requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records,
and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their
transactions and disposition of assets. Such companies are also responsible
for ensuring that their wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries comply with Section
13(b)(2)(A).

Based upon the foregoing, the Commission concludes that IBM violated
Section 13(b)(2)(A) by failing to ensure that IBM-Argentina maintained books
and records which accurately reflected IBM-Argentina's transactions and
dispositions of assets with respect to the Subcontract. The presumably illicit
payments to the foreign officials were not disclosed in IBM-Argentina's books
and records. Instead, IBM-Argentina's books and records include incomplete
and inaccurate descriptions of CCR's services, and a backdated authorization
document.

V.

In determining to accept IBM's Offer, the Commission considered remedial
acts promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded to the
Commission staff.

Vi.

Based upon the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to accept the
Offer submitted by IBM.
Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange
Act, that IBM cease and desist from committing any violation of Section 13(b)
(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by inaccurately recording payments made to CCR
pursuant to the Subcontract and from committing or causing any future
violation of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act.

By the Commission.

Secretary

 

Footnotes

1 Under the Subcontract, CCR purportedly agreed to provide certain services
to IBM-Argentina, including an alternative banking software system for BNA.
The total amount of the Subcontract was $37 million.

2 The procurement review process included formal evaluations of both the
technical and cost feasibility of all major subcontracts.

IV.

FACTS

A._Summary

In March 1999, Baker Hughes' CFO and its Controller authorized an illegal
payment, through KPMG, its agent in Indonesia, to a local government official
in Indonesia. Baker Hughes, through its CFO and Controller, directed that this
improper payment be made while knowing or aware that KPMG would pass all
or part of the payment along to a foreign government official for the purpose
of influencing the official's decision affecting the business of Baker Hughes.
This improper payment was made in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (""FCPA""). In addition, in 1998 and 1995, senior managers at Baker Hughes
authorized payments to Baker Hughes' agents in India and Brazil,
respectively, without making an adequate inquiry as to whether the agents
might give all or part of the payments to foreign government officials in
violation of the FCPA. Baker Hughes improperly recorded all three
transactions in its books and records as routine business expenditures. In
addition to its false books and records, Baker Hughes also failed to devise and
maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls to detect and
prevent improper payments to foreign government officials and to provide
reasonable assurance that transactions were recorded as necessary to permit
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles.

B. Baker Hughes Made an Improper Payment in Indonesia And
Falsified its Books and Records

1. The Indonesian Ministry of Finance's Tax Assessment

In November 1998, the Indonesian Ministry of Finance's Directorate General of
Taxation notified PTEC, an Indonesian corporation controlled by Baker
Hughes, that it would soon begin a tax audit of PTEC's 1997 tax returns.
Those returns claimed a substantial refund. The next month, the Directorate
General commenced the tax audit. In February 1999, the Directorate General
notified PTEC of its preliminary determination that PTEC's tax liability would
be assessed at $3.2 million. On February 26, 1999, as instructed by PTEC's
Finance Manager, a PTEC employee contacted KPMG and instructed KPMG to
represent PTEC before the Directorate General. Shortly after that initial
contact, the PTEC Finance Manager told KPMG that the Indonesian tax official
was seeking an improper payment.

KPMG immediately reviewed the preliminary determination by the Directorate
General and concluded that the proposed $3.2 million assessment against
PTEC was incorrect. Initially, KPMG concurred with PTEC's determination that
it was due a refund. KPMG contacted Baker Hughes' Asia-Pacific Tax Manager
(the ""Regional Tax Manager"") based in Australia with oversight responsibility
for Indonesian tax matters, and told him of its findings. KPMG suggested that
it meet with the Directorate General in an attempt to reconcile the disparity
between their respective findings. Following KPMG's advice, the Regional Tax
Manager instructed KPMG to meet with the Directorate General to discuss the
merits of the assessment and correct what KPMG believed was an incorrect
tax assessment. During these meetings, the Indonesian tax official told KPMG
that he was aware of PTEC's reputation of making ""goodwill payments"" to tax
officials, and demanded a payment of $200,000 in exchange for which he
would reduce PTEC's tax assessment. KPMG initially rejected the Indonesian
tax official's request for an illicit payment. On March 5, 1999, KPMG informed
the Regional Tax Manager of the Indonesian tax official's demand for an illicit
payment. During this conversation, the Regional Tax Manager instructed
KPMG not to pay the Indonesian tax official but to challenge the assessment
on its merits.

2. KPMG Discusses Making an Improper Payment

During several subsequent meetings between the Indonesian tax official and
KPMG, the Indonesian tax official reiterated his demand for an improper
payment. The KPMG Tax Manager assigned to the audit engagement (""KPMG
Tax Manager""), who was an Australian citizen on secondment from KPMG
Australia, informed the Regional Tax Manager of the Indonesian tax official's
continuing demand for an illicit payment. In response, the Regional Tax
Manager asked the KPMG Tax Manager to find out how much the Indonesian
tax official wanted to reduce the assessment. Because it appeared to the
KPMG Tax Manager that the Regional Tax Manager was considering making
the illicit payment, the KPMG Tax Manager met with Sonny Harsono, a senior
KPMG partner, and told him about the Indonesian tax official's continuing
demand for an illicit payment. Concerned about the applicability of the FCPA,
the KPMG Tax Manager asked Harsono how to handle the Indonesian tax
official's insistence on an illicit payment.

After listening to an explanation of the situation, Harsono advised the KPMG
Tax Manager that the FCPA was an issue because PTEC was controlled by a
U.S. public company and that KPMG should be careful in dealing with the
Indonesian tax official's demand. Notwithstanding his recognition of the
potential FCPA issues, Harsono advised the KPMG Tax Manager that if Baker
Hughes represented directly to KPMG, not through PTEC, that it wanted KPMG
to make the illicit payment, KPMG would be willing to pay the Indonesian tax
official. To conceal the improper payment, Harsono agreed with the KPMG Tax
Manager that KPMG should generate an invoice that would include money for
the payment to the Indonesian tax official and for KPMG's fees for services
rendered. As a result of his discussions with Harsono, the KPMG Tax Manager
understood that PTEC would have to provide the funds to pay the Indonesian
tax official.

3. KPMG Informs Baker Hughes of its Options

On March 8, 1999, the KPMG Tax Manager notified the Regional Tax Manager
that despite repeated requests, the Indonesian tax official was unwilling to
review the merits of the assessment without the improper payment. However,
the KPMG Tax Manager further explained that the Indonesian tax official had
told KPMG that he was now willing to reduce the assessment from $3.2 million
to $270,000 in exchange for an improper payment of $75,000. In addition, the
KPMG Tax Manager told the Regional Tax Manager that he had consulted with
Harsono and that Harsono had authorized him to make the illicit payment if
Baker Hughes wanted KPMG to make the payment. Based on his discussion
with Harsono, the KPMG Tax Manager told the Regional Tax Manager that, to
conceal the improper payment, KPMG would issue a $143,000 invoice for
""professional services rendered."" The $143,000 was comprised of $75,000 for
the Indonesian tax official, plus KPMG's actual fees and applicable taxes.
Further, the KPMG Tax Manager told the Regional Tax Manager that KPMG
was unwilling to use its own funds to pay the Indonesian tax official, but
rather required PTEC to provide the funds.

The KPMG Tax Manager concluded the conversation with the Regional Tax
Manager by noting that there were only two options available to Baker
Hughes: one, contest the $3.2 million tax assessment which, under
Indonesian law, would require immediate payment of the full assessment and
perhaps as much as two years to resolve the issue; or two, make the illicit
payment. The Regional Tax Manager told the KPMG Tax Manager that any
decision to make the payment had to be made and authorized by senior
management in Houston and that he intended to take this matter to them. In
the meantime, the Regional Tax Manager told the KPMG Tax Manager to stall
the Indonesian tax official and thus delay the issuance of the $3.2 million tax
assessment.

4. Baker Hughes' Senior Management Discuss the Proposed
Transaction

On March 9, 1999, during a conference call, the Regional Tax Manager in
Australia spoke to Harris, Baker Hughes' controller, located in Houston, and to
Baker Hughes' FCPA advisor (""FCPA advisor"") in Washington, D.C. about the
Indonesian tax official's demand for a $75,000 improper payment, KPMG's
offer to make the improper payment on PTEC's behalf using PTEC's funds, and
the method by which KPMG would conceal the payment. Further, the Regional
Tax Manager told Harris and the FCPA advisor that the Indonesian tax official
had given PTEC only 48 hours to respond to his demand and, that if PTEC
failed to meet his demand, he was prepared to issue the $3.2 million tax
assessment. The FCPA advisor advised Harris and the Regional Tax Manager
that any payment to an Indonesian tax official under the circumstances
described would violate the FCPA. In addition, the FCPA advisor instructed
Harris and the Regional Tax Manager that for KPMG to continue working for
PTEC, KPMG must first provide PTEC with specific written assurances that it
would not make any illegal payments on behalf of PTEC to any Indonesian
government official.

Shortly after the conference call, the Regional Tax Manager sent Harris a
detailed e-mail delineating the events in Indonesia and apologizing for
bringing this distasteful problem to Harris. In the e-mail, the Regional Tax
Manager discussed the urgency of the problem and described the two options
available to PTEC for resolving the tax problem that the KPMG Tax Manager
previously had identified. The Regional Tax Manager identified the option of
making the improper payment as the better one from a financial perspective
because it would provide Baker Hughes ""certainty"" and save ""significant profit
and loss costs, associated with foreign exchange risks and cost of finance."" He
also told Harris that KPMG could characterize the improper payment as a
""success fee.""

On March 10, 1999, Harris told Baker Hughes' General Counsel and Mattson,
Baker Hughes' CFO, of the Indonesian tax official's demand for an improper
payment. During this meeting, Harris told the General Counsel and Mattson
that he had talked with the FCPA advisor, who had advised him to obtain a
letter from KPMG assuring Baker Hughes that it would not make any improper
payments to any Indonesian government official on behalf of PTEC. The
General Counsel stated that the Indonesian tax official's demands raised FCPA
concerns. In response, Mattson asked the General Counsel why PTEC could
not pay KPMG and not worry about what KPMG did with the money. The
General Counsel responded by stating that Baker Hughes cannot bury its
head in the sand and ignore the problem. The General Counsel instructed
Mattson and Harris to continue working with the FCPA advisor, to follow any
directions given by the FCPA advisor, and under no circumstances to enter
into any transaction that could potentially violate the FCPA.
5. Baker Hughes' CFO and Controller Authorize the Improper
Payment

On the evening of March 10, 1999, during a conference call with Mattson and
Harris, the Regional Tax Manager reported that KPMG was unwilling to issue
the specific letter requested by the FCPA advisor. However, the Regional Tax
Manager said that KPMG indicated a willingness to issue its standard
engagement letter in lieu of the letter specifically requested by the FCPA
advisor. The Regional Tax Manager told Mattson and Harris that the standard
engagement letter referenced KPMG's international code of conduct. In
addition, the Regional Tax Manager told Mattson and Harris that PTEC's 48
hour grace period was fast running out and that the Indonesian tax official
was threatening to issue the $3.2 million assessment. Disregarding the FCPA
advisor's instructions, and acting contrary to the advice of the General
Counsel, Mattson and Harris authorized the Regional Tax Manager to proceed
with the ""success fee"" transaction without obtaining the specific letter that
the FCPA advisor had instructed they obtain. After the conference call, the
Regional Tax Manager called the KPMG Tax Manager to authorize him to
proceed with the ""success fee"" transaction. The Regional Tax Manager also
told the KPMG Tax Manager that the authorization came from the highest
level in Houston, specifically the CFO.

On March 11, 1999, KPMG created and sent a false invoice to PTEC for
$143,000. Although the invoice purported to be for professional services
rendered, in reality, it comprised the $75,000 to be paid to the Indonesian tax
official, and the remainder for KPMG's actual fees and applicable taxes. After
receiving the invoice, PTEC paid KPMG $143,000 and improperly entered the
transaction on its books and records as payment for professional services
rendered. On March 23, 1999, PTEC received a tax assessment of
approximately $270,000 from the Directorate General.

6. Baker Hughes Attempts to Unwind the Transaction and Takes
Corrective Action

After Baker Hughes' General Counsel and FCPA advisor discovered that
Mattson and Harris had authorized KPMG to make the improper payment to
the Indonesian tax official to reduce PTEC's tax assessment, Baker Hughes
embarked on a corrective course of conduct. In particular, the company:
attempted to stop the payment to KPMG; instructed KPMG not to make the
payment to the Indonesian tax official and to return the entire amount paid to
KPMG; engaged outside counsel to report to the audit committee; voluntarily
and promptly disclosed the misconduct to the Commission and the
Department of Justice; disclosed the matter to its outside auditors and
corrected its books and records; fired KPMG; asked for and obtained the
resignation of those senior management officials responsible for the violative
conduct; filed a formal objection to the $270,000 assessment with the
Directorate General and took steps to determine the correct tax deficiency;
paid $2.1 million to the Indonesian government, which it believed to be the
correct tax assessment; and implemented enhanced FCPA policies and
procedures. In addition, Baker Hughes cooperated with the Commission's
investigation, including declining to assert its attorney-client privilege with
respect to communications during the relevant time period concerning the
Indonesian transaction.

As part of its ameliorative efforts, Baker Hughes demanded that KPMG issue a
true and accurate invoice. KPMG returned Baker Hughes' $75,000 plus related
taxes and charges, and issued PTEC a true and accurate invoice in the
amount of $14,300 for professional services rendered.

C._The 1998 Transaction in India

In August 1998, Baker Hughes acquired the Western Atlas Corporation
(""Western Atlas""). At that time, Western Geophysical Corporation (""Western
Geophysical"") was a subsidiary of Western Atlas providing, among other
things, seismic services throughout the world for offshore geophysical
exploration. With the acquisition of Western Atlas, Western Geophysical
became a subsidiary of Baker Hughes.

In September 1998, under the terms of a contract signed in September 1996,
with the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Western Geophysical began
preparations to perform various 3D seismic surveys in the Bay of Canby,
India. In order for its foreign-flagged vessels to enter the Indian coastal waters
and perform the seismic surveys, Western Geophysical was required to obtain
shipping permits from the Director General of Shipping in Bombay, India.
Before the Director General of Shipping could issue the permits, Western
Geophysical had to obtain a ""no objection certificate"" from the Indian Coastal
Commission (""ICC""), an organization of private Indian-flagged vessels, stating
that there were no suitable Indian-flagged vessels available to carry out the
seismic operations.

On October 14, 1998, while Western Geophysical's foreign-flagged vessels
were en route to India, an agent for Western Geophysical was working on
securing the permits from the Director General of Shipping. The agent
contacted the General Manager for Western Geophysical's Far East, Australia
and China Operations (""General Manager"") who, at the time, was traveling in
Hong Kong. The Western Geophysical agent told the General Manager that
the company needed to obtain permits before its foreign-flagged vessels
could enter Indian coastal waters. The Western Geophysical agent advised the
General Manager that if the General Manager provided $15,000, he might be
able to get the permits issued. The General Manager authorized the agent to
""take care of it."" Shortly after the General Manager's authorization, the
Western Geophysical agent obtained the necessary shipping permits, without
obtaining the ""no objection certificate.""

Thereafter, the Western Geophysical agent requested a reimbursement of the
$15,000 payment. A Western Geophysical employee in the accounting
department sent an e-mail to the General Manager in the United States
seeking authorization to pay the agent. Without making an adequate inquiry
to ensure that all or part of the $15,000 would not be paid to a foreign
government official in violation of the FCPA, the General Manager authorized
the payment of $15,000 to the Western Geophysical agent. Subsequently,
Western Geophysical's accounting staff improperly recorded the $15,000
payment: (a) without determining to whom the money ultimately would be
paid or the specific purpose of the payment; and (b) by inaccurately
describing the payment on its books and records as payment for a ""Shipping
Permit.""

D. The 1995 Transaction in Brazil

In 1995, Baker Hughes planned and implemented a two part restructuring of
its operations in Brazil. The first part of the restructuring involved merging
several of Baker Hughes' Brazilian subsidiaries into Centrilift, another Baker
Hughes subsidiary. Upon completion of the merger, Baker Hughes
reincorporated and renamed Centrilift ""Baker Hughes do Brasil Ltda."" (""BHB"").
The second part of the restructuring involved transferring the assets and
liabilities of Baker Hughes Equipamentos Ltda. (""BHEL""), another Baker
Hughes subsidiary, to BHB and leaving BHEL dormant. BHEL's Finance
Director (""Finance Director"") and Baker Hughes' International Tax Manager
(""International Tax Manager""), who was also the team leader for the
reorganization, believed that the restructuring, as planned, had to be
completed by Baker Hughes' September 30, 1995 fiscal year end, in order for
Baker Hughes to take a $40 million U.S. tax deduction in that year. Before the
restructuring became effective, Brazilian law required that BHB file various
documents with, and receive the approval of, the Commercial Registry in Rio
de Janeiro (""Commercial Registry"").

In August 1995, a Brazilian agent representing BHEL informed the Finance
Director that he needed $10,000 in order to obtain the approval from the
Commercial Registry that was necessary to complete the restructuring within
a week. The Finance Director sought approval for this payment from the
International Tax Manager. The International Tax Manager informed his
supervisor of the agent's request for $10,000 to obtain the approval from the
Commercial Registry. Without making an adequate inquiry to ensure that all
or part of the $10,000 would not be paid to a foreign government official in
violation of the FCPA, Baker Hughes authorized the Finance Director to pay
the $10,000. Based on this authorization, the Finance Director paid the agent
$10,000 on August 30, 1995. Subsequently, Baker Hughes improperly
recorded the $10,000 payment: (a) without determining to whom the money
ultimately would be paid or the specific purpose of the payment; and (b) by
inaccurately describing the payment as an ""advance payment for expenses
related to the commercial registry board of Rio de Janeiro.""

V.
LEGAL DISCUSSION

A. Applicable Law

The FCPA, first enacted in 1977, amended the Exchange Act to make it
unlawful for U.S. issuers, or anyone acting at their behest, to make improper
payments to any foreign official in order to obtain or retain business. Section
30A of the Exchange Act. In addition, the FCPA established accounting control
requirements for issuers subject to either the registration or reporting
provisions of the Exchange Act. Section 13 of the Exchange Act.

Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act requires every issuer with a class of
securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act to make and
keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer.
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act requires every issuer to devise and
maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization; and (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria
applicable to such statements, and to maintain accountability for assets.

B. Violations by Baker Hughes

Baker Hughes, through its CFO and Controller, authorized PTEC to pay KPMG
$143,000 at a time when PTEC had a tax assessment matter pending before
the Indonesian tax authorities. Baker Hughes' CFO and Controller knew or
were aware of a high probability that KPMG intended to use $75,000 of the
$143,000 to pay the Indonesian government tax official who was conducting
PTEC's tax audit. Further, Baker Hughes' CFO and Controller knew that the
$75,000 payment to the Indonesian tax official was to be made to obtain a
reduction in its tax assessment from $3.2 million to approximately $270,000.
Subsequent to the payment to KPMG, PTEC recorded the $143,000 payment
to KPMG on its books and records as payment for professional services
rendered knowing that the entry did not accurately and fairly reflect the
disposition of its assets. Such conduct violated the books and records and
internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B).

Baker Hughes, through Western Geophysical's General Manager for Western
Geophysical's Far East, Australia and China Operations, authorized Western
Geophysical to pay one of its agents $15,000 to obtain shipping permits from
the Director General of Shipping. The General Manager authorized the
$15,000 payment without determining to whom the money ultimately would
be paid or the specific purpose of the payment. In addition, Baker Hughes
recorded the $15,000 payment on its books and records in a manner that did
not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the disposition of its
assets. Accordingly, Baker Hughes' conduct violated the books and records
and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
(B).

Baker Hughes, through its Director of Taxes and International Tax Manager,
authorized BHEL to pay one of its agents $10,000 to obtain from the
Commercial Registry the approval necessary to complete its restructuring.
Baker Hughes authorized the $10,000 payment without determining to whom
the money ultimately would be paid or the specific purpose of the payment. In
addition, Baker Hughes recorded the $10,000 payment on its books and
records in a manner that did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the disposition of its assets. Accordingly, Baker Hughes' conduct
violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B).

Vi.

SEC Charges Germany-Based Allianz SE with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2012-266

Washington, D.C., Dec. 17, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Germany-based insurance and asset
management company Allianz SE with violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) for improper payments to government officials in Indonesia during a seven-year period.

The SECâs investigation uncovered 295 insurance contracts on large government projects that were obtained or retained by improper
payments of $650,626 by Allianzâs subsidiary in Indonesia to employees of state-owned entities. Allianz made more than $5.3 million in
profits as a result of the improper payments.

Allianz, which is headquartered in Munich, agreed to pay more than $12.3 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âAllianzâs subsidiary created an 'off-the-books' account that served as a slush fund for bribe payments to foreign officials to win insurance
contracts worth several million dollars,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings against Allianz, the misconduct occurred from 2001 to 2008 while
the companyâs shares and bonds were registered with the SEC and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Two complaints brought the
misconduct to Allianzâs attention. The first complaint submitted in 2005 reported unsupported payments to agents, and a subsequent audit of
accounting records at Allianzâs subsidiary in Indonesia uncovered that managers were using âspecial purpose accountsâ to make illegal
payments to government officials in order to secure business in Indonesia. The misconduct continued in spite of that audit.

According to the SECâs order, the second complaint was made to Allianzâs external auditor in 2009. Allianz failed to properly account for
certain payments in their books and records. The improper payments were disguised in invoices as an âoverriding commissionâ for an agent
that was not associated with the government insurance contract. In other instances, the improper payments were structured as an
overpayment by the government insurance contract holder, who was later âreimbursedâ for the overpayment. Excess funds were then paid to
foreign officials who were responsible for procuring the government insurance contracts. Allianz lacked sufficient internal controls to detect
and prevent the wrongful payments and improper accounting.

The SECâs order found that Allianz violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, specifically Sections 13(b)(2)
(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Allianz agreed to cease and desist from
further violations and pay disgorgement of $5,315,649, prejudgment interest of $1,765,125, and a penalty of $5,315,649 for a total of
$12,396,423.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Irene Gutierrez, Jennifer Baskin and Tracy L. Price of the FCPA Unit.

",2012-266,--ERROR--,SEC Charges Germany-Based Allianz SE with FCPA Violations.,"Washington, D.C., Dec. 17, 2012 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Germany-based insurance and asset management company Allianz SE with violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for improper payments to government officials in Indonesia during a seven-year period.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C.

Litigation Release No.17127 / September 12, 2001

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1446 / September
12, 2001

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION v. KPMG SIDDHARTA SIDDHARTA & HARSONO AND
SONNY HARSONO, Civil Action No. H-01-3105 (S.D. Tex.) (filed
September 11, 2001)

SEC AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILE FIRST-EVER JOINT CIVIL
ACTION AGAINST KPMG SIDDHARTA SIDDHARTA & HARSONO AND ITS
PARTNER SONNY HARSONO FOR AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF A
BRIBE IN INDONESIA

On September 11, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
United States Department of Justice filed a joint civil injunctive action in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division, against KPMG Siddharta Siddharta & Harsono (""KPMG-SSH""), a public
accounting firm in Jakarta, Indonesia and Sonny Harsono (""Harsono""), a
partner of KPMG-SSH. KPMG-SSH is an affiliate firm of KPMG International. This
is the first time that the Commission and the Department of Justice, both of
which have jurisdiction over the antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (""FCPA""), have combined to file a joint civil action.

The complaint alleges that in 1999, Harsono authorized KPMG-SSH personnel
to bribe an Indonesian tax official on behalf of one of KPMG-SSH's clients, PT
Eastman Christensen (""PTEC""), an Indonesian company beneficially owned by
Baker Hughes Incorporated (""Baker Hughes""). KPMG-SSH agreed to make the
illicit payment to influence the Indonesian tax official to reduce a tax
assessment for PTEC from $3.2 million to $270,000. Harsono advised KPMG-
SSH personnel that if Baker Hughes represented directly to KPMG-SSH, not
through PTEC, that it wanted KPMG-SSH to make the illicit payment, KPMG-
SSH would be willing to pay the Indonesian tax official. To conceal the
improper payment, Harsono agreed with KPMG-SSH personnel that KPMG-SSH
should generate an invoice that would include money for the payment to the
Indonesian tax official and for KPMG-SSH's fees for services rendered. The
false invoice, although purporting to be for professional services rendered, in
reality represented $75,000 to be paid to an Indonesian tax official, and the
remainder for KPMG-SSH's actual fees and applicable taxes. After receiving
the invoice, PTEC paid KPMG-SSH $143,000 and improperly entered the
transaction on its books and records as payment for professional services
rendered. On March 23, 1999, PTEC received a tax assessment of
approximately $270,000 from the Indonesian government, almost $3 million
lower than the original assessment.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants
have consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins
both defendants from violating and aiding and abetting the violation of the
antibribery provisions of the FCPA and the internal controls and books and
records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"")
(Sections 104A(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the FCPA and Sections 30A(a)(1), (2) and
(3), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).

The Commission also filed, on September 11, 2001, a civil injunctive action in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston
Division, against Mattson and Harris alleging that they authorized the
payment of a bribe of $75,000 through KPMG-SSH. Mattson and Harris
directed that this payment be made while knowing that KPMG-SSH would pass
all or part of the payment along to a foreign government official for the
purpose of influencing the Indonesian tax official to issue a lower tax
assessment for PTEC. The complaint alleges that Mattson and Harris violated
Sections 30A(a) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule
13b2-1 promulgated thereunder and aided and abetted Baker Hughes'
violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B). See Litigation Release No.
17126 (September 12, 2001).

Finally, in a related action, the Commission instituted, on September 12,
2001, settled administrative proceedings against Baker Hughes. The
Commission's Order finds that, in March 1999, Baker Hughes' CFO and its
Controller authorized the above-described illegal payment, through KPMG-
SSH, its agent in Indonesia, to a local government official in Indonesia. The
Order also finds that in 1998 and 1995, senior managers at Baker Hughes
authorized payments to Baker Hughes' agents in India and Brazil,
respectively, without making an adequate inquiry as to whether the agents
might give all or part of the payments to foreign government officials in
violation of the FCPA. Without admitting or denying the Commission's
findings, Baker Hughes consented to the entry of the Commission's Order.
The Order directs that Baker Hughes cease and desist from committing or
causing any violation and any future violation of the internal controls and
books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act). See Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 44784 (September 12, 2001); Accounting and Auditing
Enforcement Release No. 1447.

The Commission wishes to thank the United States Department of Justice for
its assistance in this matter.

Halliburton Paying $29.2 Million to Settle FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2017-133

Washington D.C., July 27, 2017 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Halliburton Company with violating the books and
records and internal accounting controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) while selecting and making payments to a
local company in Angola in the course of winning lucrative oilfield services contracts.

Halliburton, which profited by approximately $14 million from the deals, has agreed to pay more than $29.2 million to settle the SECâs case.
The company also agreed to obtain an independent compliance consultant to oversee its anti-corruption policies and procedures in Africa.
Halliburtonâs former vice president Jeannot Lorenz has agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty for causing the companyâs violations, circumventing
internal accounting controls, and falsifying books and records.

According to the SECâs order, officials at Angolaâs state oil company Sonangol advised Halliburton management in 2008 that it was required
to partner with more local Angolan-owned businesses to satisfy local content regulations for foreign firms operating in Angola. Halliburton
tasked Lorenz to spearhead these efforts. When a new round of oil company projects came up for bid, Lorenz began a lengthy effort to retain
a local Angolan company owned by a former Halliburton employee who was a friend and neighbor of the Sonangol official who would
ultimately approve the award of the contracts. It took three attempts but Halliburton ultimately outsourced more than $13 million worth of
business to the local Angolan company.

The SECâs order finds that Halliburton entered into contracts with the local Angolan company that were intended to meet local content
requirements rather than the stated scope of work. Lorenz violated Halliburtonâs internal accounting controls by starting with the local
Angolan company and then backing into a list of contract services rather than first determining the services and then selecting an
appropriate supplier. Lorenz also failed to conduct competitive bidding or substantiate the need for a single source of supply, and he avoided
an internal accounting control that required contracts of more than $10,000 in countries like Angola with high corruption risks to be reviewed
and approved by a special committee within Halliburton. The company eventually paid $3.705 million to the local Angolan firm, and Sonangol
approved the award of seven lucrative subcontracts to Halliburton.

âHalliburton committed to using a particular supplier that posed significant FCPA risks and a company vice president circumvented important
internal accounting controls to get the deal done quickly,â said Antonia Chion, Associate Director in the SECâs Enforcement Division.
âCompanies and their executives must comply with these internal accounting controls that help ensure the integrity of corporate
transactions.â

Without admitting or denying the findings, Halliburton and Lorenz consented to the order requiring them to cease and desist from committing
or causing any violations or any future violations of the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA.
Halliburton agreed to pay $14 million in disgorgement plus $1.2 million in prejudgment interest and a $14 million penalty. Halliburton must
retain an independent compliance consultant for 18 months to review and evaluate its anti-corruption policies and procedures, particularly in
regard to local content obligations for business operations in Africa.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Ansu N. Banerjee and Steven A. Susswein with assistance from Alfred Day and Thomas Bednar.
The case was supervised by Melissa R. Hodgman and Ms. Chion. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice and

",2017-133,--ERROR--,Halliburton Paying $29.2 Million to Settle FCPA Violations.,"Washington D.C., July 27, 2017 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Halliburton Company with violating the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) while selecting and making payments to a local company in Angola in the course of winning lucrative oilfield services contracts.

Halliburton, which profited by approximately $14 million from the deals, has agreed to pay more than $29.2 million to settle the SEC’s case.
 The company also agreed to obtain an independent compliance consultant to oversee its anti-corruption policies and procedures in Africa.
 Halliburton’s former vice president Jeannot Lorenz has agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty for causing the company’s violations, circumventing internal accounting controls, and falsifying books and records.

According to the SEC’s order, officials at Angola’s state oil company Sonangol advised Halliburton management in 2008 that it was required to partner with more local Angolan-owned businesses to satisfy local content regulations for foreign firms operating in Angola. Halliburton tasked Lorenz to spearhead these efforts. When a new round of oil company projects came up for bid, Lorenz began a lengthy effort to retain a local Angolan company owned by a former Halliburton employee who was a friend and neighbor of the Sonangol official who would ultimately approve the award of the contracts. It took three attempts but Halliburton ultimately outsourced more than $13 million worth of business to the local Angolan company.

The SEC’s order finds that Halliburton entered into contracts with the local Angolan company that were intended to meet local content requirements rather than the stated scope of work.

SEC Charges California Telecommunications Company
With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-115

Washington, D.C., June 29, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed a settled federal court action against San Jose, Calif.-based
telecommunications company Veraz Networks, Inc., alleging that Veraz
violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The alleged violations stemmed from improper
payments made by Veraz to foreign officials in China and Vietnam after the
company went public in 2007.

The SEC alleges that Veraz engaged a consultant in China who in 2007 and
2008 gave gifts and offered improper payment together valued at
approximately $40,000 to officials at a government controlled
telecommunications company in China in an attempt to win business for
Veraz. A Veraz supervisor who approved the gifts described them in an
internal Veraz email as the ""gift scheme."" Similarly in 2007 and 2008, the SEC
alleges that a Veraz employee made improper payments to the CEO of a
government controlled telecommunications company in Vietnam to win
business for Veraz.

""It is particularly important that newly public companies doing business
overseas establish the appropriate policies and procedures to prevent a
culture of payment to foreign officials from developing,"" said Marc J. Fagel,
Regional Director of the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office.

According to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, Veraz violated the books and records and internal
controls provisions of the FCPA by failing to accurately record the improper
payments on its books and records, and failing to devise and maintain a
system of effective internal controls to prevent such payments. Veraz, without
admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint,
consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining Veraz from
future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering Veraz to pay a penalty of $300,000.

This case was investigated by Monique C. Winkler, Robert S. Leach, and Cary
Robnett of the San Francisco Regional Office.

The Commission would like to thank the U.S. Department of Homeland
Security for its assistance in this matter.

SEC Charges Massachusetts-Based Scientific Instruments
Manufacturer with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-280

Washington D.C., Dec. 15, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Billerica, Mass.-based global manufacturer of
scientific instruments with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing non-business related travel and improper payments
to various Chinese government officials in an effort to win business.

An SEC investigation found that Bruker Corporation lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect approximately $230,000 in
improper payments out of its China-based offices that falsely recorded them in books and records as legitimate business and marketing
expenses. The payments enabled Bruker to realize approximately $1.7 million in profits from sales contracts with state-owned entities in
China whose officials received the improper payments.

Bruker, which self-reported its misconduct and provided extensive cooperation during the SECâs investigation, agreed to pay approximately
$2.4 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âBrukerâs lax internal controls allowed employees in its China offices to enter into sham âcollaboration agreementsâ to direct money to foreign
officials and send officials on sightseeing trips around the world,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.
âThe company has since taken significant remedial steps to revise its compliance program and enhance internal controls over travel and
contract approvals.â

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, a Bruker office in China paid more than $111,000 to Chinese
government officials under 12 suspicious collaboration agreements contingent on state-owned entities providing research on Bruker products
or using Bruker products in demonstration laboratories. The collaboration agreements did not specify the work product that the state-owned
entities had to provide in order to be paid, and no work product was actually provided to the Bruker office by the state-owned entities.
Certain collaboration agreements were executed directly with a Chinese government official rather than the state-owned entity itself, and in
some cases Brukerâs office paid the official directly.

According to the SECâs order, the other improper payments involved reimbursements to Chinese government officials for leisure travel to the
United States, Czech Republic, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. These officials often were responsible for
authorizing the purchase of Bruker products, and the leisure trips typically followed business-related travel for the officials funded by the
company. For example, Bruker paid for the purported training expenses of a Chinese government official who signed the sales contract on
behalf of a state-owned entity, but the payment actually was reimbursement for sightseeing, tour tickets, shopping, and other leisure
activities in Frankfurt and Paris. Bruker also funded some trips for Chinese government officials that had no legitimate business component.
For example, two Chinese government officials received paid travel to New York despite the lack of any Bruker facilities there, and also to Los
Angeles where they engaged in sightseeing activities.

The SECâs order finds that Bruker violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
company agreed to pay $1,714,852 in disgorgement, $310,117 in prejudgment interest, and a $375,000 penalty. Bruker consented to the
order without admitting or denying the findings, and the SEC considered the companyâs significant remedial acts as well as its self-reporting
and cooperation with the investigation when determining a settlement.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Asita Obeyesekere and Mark Albers of the Boston Regional Office. The case was supervised by
Paul G. Block of the FCPA Unit.

GlaxoSmithKline Pays $20 Million Penalty to Settle FCPA Violations

September 30, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that
GlaxoSmithKline ple (âGSKââ) has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that it violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its China-based subsidiaries engaged in pay-to-
prescribe schemes to increase sales.

An SEC investigation found that the schemes spanned a period of years and involved the transfer
of money, gifts, and other things of value to health care professionals, which led to millions of
dollars in increased sales of GSK pharmaceutical products to Chinaâs state health institutions.
The participants included certain complicit sales and marketing managers within GSKâs China-
based subsidiaries. GSK failed to devise and maintain a sufficient system of internal accounting
controls and lacked an effective anti-corruption compliance program to detect and prevent these
schemes. As a result, the improper payments were not accurately reflected in GSKâs books and
records.

The SECâs order finds that GSK violated the FCPAâs internal controls and books-and-records
provisions. GSK consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings, and agreed to
pay a $20 million civil penalty. GSK also agreed to provide status reports to the SEC for the
next two years on its remediation and implementation of anti-corruption compliance measures.

SEC Charges Goldman Sachs With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2020-265

Washington D.C., Oct. 22, 2020 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against The Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) bribe scheme,
and as part of coordinated resolutions, it has agreed to pay more than $2.9 billion, which includes more than $1 billion to settle the SECâs

charges.

According to the SECâs order, beginning in 2012, former senior employees of Goldman Sachs used a third-party intermediary to bribe high-
ranking government officials in Malaysia and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The order finds that these bribes enabled Goldman Sachs to obtain
lucrative business from 1MDB, a Malaysian government-owned investment fund, including underwriting approximately $6.5 billion in bond

offerings.

âCorruption risks can be posed by those at all levels of a company, including in the senior ranks. This case demonstrates how important it is
for companies to have controls that are tailored to the risks presented by persons employed at all levels,â said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC
Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SECâs order finds that Goldman Sachs violated the anti-bribery, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions of the
federal securities laws. Goldman Sachs agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay $606.3 million in disgorgement and a $400 million civil
penalty, with the amount of disgorgement satisfied by amounts it paid to the Government of Malaysia and 1MDB in a related settlement.

In December 2019, the SEC charged former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. participating managing director Tim Leissner for his role in the LMDB
bribery scheme.

SEC Charges Stryker Corporation With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2013-229

Washington D.C., Oct. 24, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a Michigan-based medical technology company
with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when subsidiaries in five different countries bribed doctors, health care professionals,
and other government-employed officials in order to obtain or retain business.

An SEC investigation found that Stryker Corporationâs subsidiaries in Argentina, Greece, Mexico, Poland, and Romania made illicit payments
totaling approximately $2.2 million that were incorrectly described as legitimate expenses in the companyâs books and records. Descriptions
varied from a charitable donation to consulting and service contracts, travel expenses, and commissions. Stryker made approximately $7.5
million in illicit profits as a result of the improper payments.

Stryker has agreed to pay more than $13.2 million to settle the SECâs charges.

âStrykerâs misconduct involved hundreds of improper payments over a number of years during which the companyâs internal controls were
fatally flawed,â said Andrew M. Calamari, director of the SECâs New York Regional Office. âCompanies that allow corruption to occur by failing
to implement robust compliance programs will not be allowed to profit from their misconduct.â

The SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings details improper payments by employees of Strykerâs subsidiaries as far back
as 2003. They used third parties to make the payments in order to win or keep lucrative contracts for the sale of Strykerâs medical
technology products. For example, in January 2006, Strykerâs subsidiary in Mexico directed a law firm to pay approximately $46,000 to a
Mexican government employee in order to secure the winning bid on a contract. The result was $1.1 million in profits for Stryker. The
subsidiary reimbursed the Mexico-based law firm for the bribe and booked the payment as a legitimate legal expense. However, no legal
services were actually provided and the law firm simply acted as a funnel to pay the bribe.

According to the SECâs order, Strykerâs subsidiary in Greece made a purported âdonationâ of nearly $200,000 in 2007 to a public university in
Greece to fund a laboratory that was a pet project of a public hospital doctor. In exchange for the payment, the doctor agreed to provide
business to Stryker.

The SECâs investigation also found that Strykerâs subsidiaries bribed foreign officials by paying their expenses for trips that lacked any
legitimate business purpose. For example, in exchange for the promise of future business from the director of a public hospital in Poland,
Stryker paid travel costs for the director and her husband in May 2004. This included a six-night stay at a New York City hotel, attendance at
two Broadway shows, and a five-day trip to Aruba.

The SECâs order requires Stryker to pay disgorgement of $7,502,635, prejudgment interest of $2,280,888, and a penalty of $3.5 million.
Without admitting or denying the allegations, Stryker agreed to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future
violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The SECâs investigation was led by Sharon Binger and Justin Alfano of the New York Regional Office with significant assistance from the
Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

34-77288-s,"SEC Charges Engineer and Former Employer with Bribe Scheme in Russia

March 3, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged an engineer with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by scheming to bribe Russian government
officials and obtain drug approvals for his then-employer while secretly enriching himself. The
SEC also charged the company with lacking sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent the
scheme.

An SEC investigation found that Mikhail Gourevitch arranged improper payments from global
health science company Nordion Inc. to a third-party agent so that a portion of the funds could be
used to bribe Russian officials to approve the distribution of a liver cancer treatment called
TheraSphere. Gourevitch provided false documentation to Nordion to conceal the scheme, and
received $100,000 in kickbacks from the third-party agent.

Gourevitch, whose employment was terminated by Nordion, agreed to settle the charges by
paying $100,000 in disgorgement, $12,950 in prejudgment interest, and a $66,000 penalty.

Nordion, which traded on the New York Stock Exchange when the scheme occurred from 2004
to 2011, agreed to pay a $375,000 penalty to settle charges that it lacked internal accounting
controls and basic FCPA due diligence to prevent Gourevitch from conducting the scheme. The
SEC considered the companyâs significant cooperation, self-reporting and remedial acts when
determining a settlement. Once Nordion discovered evidence of misconduct by Gourevitch, the

SEC Sanctions Statoil for Bribes to Iranian Government
Official

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2006-174

Washington, D.C., Oct. 13, 2006 - The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced the institution of a settled enforcement action against
Statoil, ASA, a Norway-based and New York Stock Exchange listed
multinational oil company, for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA), which prohibits bribery of foreign government officials. The
Commission's Order finds that Statoil paid bribes to an Iranian government
official in return for his influence to assist Statoil in obtaining a contract to
develop a significant oil and gas field in Iran and to open doors to additional
projects in the Iranian oil and gas industry.

Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Statoil consented
to entry of an administrative Order that requires Statoil to pay disgorgement
of $10.5 million. The Order also requires Statoil to cease and desist from
committing violations of the antibribery, internal controls and books and
records provisions of the FCPA and to retain an independent compliance
consultant to review and report on Statoil's compliance with the FCPA. Ina
related criminal proceeding announced today, Statoil has agreed to pay a
criminal penalty of $10.5 million pursuant to a deferred prosecution
agreement with the United States Department of Justice and the United States
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Three million of the
$10.5 million penalty is deemed satisfied by a penalty previously paid to the
Norwegian criminal authorities.

""The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for public companies to
pay bribes to a foreign government official,"" said Mark K. Schonfeld, Director
of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office. ""The Commission is charged
with enforcing this anti-corruption law against public companies in order to
maintain a level playing field and encourage fair play and competition.""

The Order finds that:

e In June 2002 and January 2003, Statoil paid bribes to an Iranian
government official intending to (i) induce the Iranian Official to use his
influence with the Iranian state-run oil company; (ii) influence the
Iranian state-run oil company's decision about whether to award Statoil
a development contract; and (iii) secure improper advantage for Statoil
by positioning it to obtain future business in Iran, potentially worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.

e Statoil agreed to pay the Iranian official through a vaguely defined
consulting contract with an offshore intermediary company organized in
Turks and Caicos and owned by a third party located in London,
England. The consulting contract obligated Statoil to make initial
payments of $200,000 and $5 million, and ten subsequent annual
payments of $1 million each. Statoil made the initial payments of $5.2
million to the Iranian official, but in June 2003, Statoil suspended further
payments.

e In return for the payments, the Iranian official used his influence to
assist Statoil in obtaining business in Iran by, for example, providing
Statoil employees in Iran nonpublic information concerning oil and gas
projects in Iran and showing Statoil copies of bid documents of
competing companies that were otherwise not available to Statoil. In
October 2002, Statoil obtained the contract to develop a significant oil
and gas field.

e During the relevant time period, Statoil employees circumvented
Statoil's internal controls and procedures that were in place to prevent
illegal payments, and Statoil lacked sufficient internal controls. In
addition, by mischaracterizing the payments as legitimate consulting
fees, Statoil violated the books and records provisions of the federal
securities laws.

Statoil cooperated with the Commission's investigation and took a number of
remedial steps as outlined in the Commission's Order.

The Commission appreciates the assistance in this investigation of the United
States Department of Justice, Fraud Division, and the United States Attorney's
Office for the Southern District of New York.

SEC Charges Brazilian Meat Producers With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2020-254

Washington D.C., Oct. 14, 2020 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Brazilian nationals Joesley Batista and
Wesley Batista and their companies J&F Investimentos S.A. and JBS S.A., a global meat and protein producer, have agreed to pay nearly $27
million to resolve charges arising out of an extensive bribery scheme that took place over multiple years.

The SECâs order finds that the Batistas engaged in a bribery scheme in part to facilitate JBSâs 2009 acquisition of U.S. issuer Pilgrimâs Pride
Corporation. According to the order, following that acquisition and while serving as board members of Pilgrimâs, the Batistas made payments
of approximately $150 million in bribes at the direction of a former Brazil Finance Minister using in part funds from intercompany transfers,
dividend payments, and other means obtained from JBS operating accounts containing funds from Pilgrimâs. As set forth in the order, the
Batistas exerted significant control over Pilgrimâs, which shared office space, overlapping board members and executives, accounting and
SAP systems, and certain internal accounting controls and policy documents with JBS and its U.S. affiliate JBS USA. The order finds that as a
result of that control, the Batistas caused the failure of Pilgrimâs to maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls and accurate
books and records. The order also finds that the Batistas, who signed Pilgrimâs Prideâs financial statements, did not disclose their conduct to
Pilgrimâs Prideâs accountants and independent public accountants.

âEngaging in bribery to finance their expansion into the U.S. markets and then continuing to engage in bribery while occupying senior board
positions at Pilgrim's reflects a profound failure to exercise good corporate governance,â said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement
Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âThis brazen misconduct flies in the face of what investors should expect from those occupying the role of an officer or
director of a U.S. issuer.â

Joesley Batista, Wesley Batista, J&F, and JBS consented to the SECâs order finding that they caused Pilgrimâs Prideâs violations of the books
and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and agreed to cease-and-desist orders. Further, JBS agreed to pay
approximately $27 million in disgorgement and the Batistas each agreed to pay a civil penalty of $550,000. The parties must also comply
with a three-year undertaking to self-report on the status of certain remedial measures. As also announced today by the Department of
Justice, J&F pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and will pay a criminal penalty of over $256 million.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Maria F. Boodoo and Michelle L. Ramos. The case was supervised by Tracy L. Price. The SEC
appreciates the cooperation of the Ministerio Publico Federal and the Procuradoria-Geral da Republica in Brazil.

SEC Charges Alexion Pharmaceuticals With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2020-149

Washington D.C., July 2, 2020 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Boston-based pharmaceutical company
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. has agreed to pay more than $21 million to resolve charges that it violated the books and records and internal
accounting controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

According to the SECâs order, two Alexion subsidiaries made payments to foreign government officials to secure favorable treatment for
Alexionâs primary drug, Soliris. The order finds that, from 2010 to 2015, Alexion Turkey paid Turkish government officials to improperly
influence them to approve patient prescriptions and provide other favorable regulatory treatment for Soliris. The order similarly finds that
from 2011 to 2015, Alexion Russia made improper payments to Russian government health care officials to favorably influence the regulatory
treatment of and the budget allocated to Soliris as well as to increase the number of approved Soliris prescriptions. Alexion Russia and
Alexion Turkey maintained false books and records of these improper payments, which Alexionâs internal accounting controls were not
sufficient to detect or prevent. Further, the order finds that Alexionâs subsidiaries in Brazil and Colombia failed to maintain accurate books
and records, including by creating or directing third parties to create inaccurate financial records concerning payments to patient advocacy
organizations.

âAlexionâs internal accounting controls failed to detect and prevent payments to foreign government officials by its subsidiaries,â said Melissa
Hodgman, an Associate Director in the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âCompanies in frequent contact with foreign officials need to ensure
that their internal controls appropriately address such risks.â

Without admitting or denying the SECâs findings, Alexion agreed to cease and desist from committing violations of the books and records and
internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and pay $14,210,194 in disgorgement, $3,766,337 in prejudgment interest, and a $3.5
million penalty.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Christina McGill and Brittany Hamelers. The investigation was supervised by Timothy England and
Melissa Hodgman.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 18740 / June 9, 2004

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Schering-Plough Corporation,
United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil Action
No. 1:04CV00945 (PLF)

SEC FILES SETTLED ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST
SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION FOR FOREIGN
CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT VIOLATIONS

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has filed a
complaint in federal court seeking a civil penalty against Schering-Plough
Corporation, for violating the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Commission's complaint
alleges that, between February 1999 and March 2002, one of Schering-
Plough's foreign subsidiaries, Schering-Plough Poland, made improper
payments to a charitable organization called the Chudow Castle Foundation.
The Foundation was headed by an individual who was the Director of the
Silesian Health Fund during the relevant time. The health fund was a Polish
governmental body that, among other things, provided money for the
purchase of pharmaceutical products and influenced the purchase of those
products by other entities, such as hospitals, through the allocation of health
fund resources. According to the complaint, Schering-Plough Poland paid
315,800 zlotys (approximately $76,000) to the Chudow Castle Foundation to
induce the Director to influence the health fund's purchase of Schering-
Plough's pharmaceutical products.

The complaint alleges that none of the payments made by Schering-Plough
Poland to the Foundation was accurately reflected on the subsidiary's books
and records. The complaint also alleges that the company's system of internal
accounting controls was inadequate to prevent or detect the improper
payments. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint,
Schering-Plough consented to pay a $500,000 civil penalty.

In a related enforcement action announced today, Schering-Plough
consented, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, to the
issuance of a Commission Order requiring Schering-Plough to cease and
desist from committing or causing violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)
(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. Schering-Plough also was ordered to comply with
its undertakings to retain an independent consultant to review the company's
policies and procedures regarding compliance with the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and to implement any changes recommended by the consultant.
(Rel. No. 34-49838; File No. 3-11517).

The Commission's investigation is continuing as to others.

SEC Charges Hewlett-Packard With FCPA Violations

Company to Pay $108 Million to Settle Civil and Criminal Cases

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-73

Washington D.C., April 9, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Hewlett-Packard with violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries in three different countries made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain
lucrative public contracts.

Hewlett-Packard has agreed to pay more than $108 million to settle the SECâs charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the
U.S. Department of Justice.

The SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings finds that the Palo Alto, Calif.-based technology companyâs subsidiary in Russia
paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multi-million dollar
contract with the federal prosecutorâs office. In Poland, Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than
$600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency. And as part of its bid to win a software sale to
Mexicoâs state-owned petroleum company, Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a
consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials.

âHewlett-Packard lacked the internal controls to stop a pattern of illegal payments to win business in Mexico and Eastern Europe. The
companyâs books and records reflected the payments as legitimate commissions and expenses,â said Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC
Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âCompanies have a fundamental obligation to ensure that their internal controls are both reasonably
designed and appropriately implemented across their entire business operations, and they should take a hard look at the agents conducting
business on their behalf.â

According to the SECâs order, the scheme involving Hewlett-Packardâs Russian subsidiary occurred from approximately 2000 to 2007. The
bribes were paid through agents and consultants in order to win a government contract for computer hardware and software. Employees
within the subsidiary and elsewhere raised questions about the significant markup being paid to the agent on the deal and the subcontractors
that the agent expected to use. Despite the red flags, the deal went forward without any meaningful due diligence on the agent or the
subcontractors.

The SECâs order finds that bribes involving Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary in Poland occurred from approximately 2006 to 2010. Acting
primarily through its public sector sales manager, the subsidiary agreed to pay a Polish government official in order to win contracts for
information technology products and services. The official received a percentage of net revenue earned from the contracts, and the bribes
were delivered in cash from off-the-books accounts.

According to the SECâs order, Hewlett-Packardâs subsidiary in Mexico paid a consultant to help the company win a public IT contract worth
approximately $6 million. At least $125,000 was funneled to a government official at the state-owned petroleum company with whom the
consultant had connections. Although the consultant was not an approved deal partner and had not been subjected to the due diligence
required under company policy, HP Mexico sales managers used a pass-through entity to pay inflated commissions to the consultant. This
was internally referred to as the âinfluencer fee.â

Hewlett-Packard consented to the SECâs order, which finds that it violated the internal controls and books and records provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The company agreed to pay $29 million in disgorgement (approximately $26.47 million to the SEC and
$2.53 million to satisfy an IRS forfeiture as part of the criminal matter). Hewlett-Packard also agreed to pay prejudgment interest of $5
million to the SEC and fines totaling $74.2 million in the criminal case for a total of more than $108 million in disgorgement and penalties.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by David A. Berman and Tracy L. Davis of the FCPA Unit in San Francisco. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of California as well as the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and Public Prosecutorâs Office in Dresden, Germany.

Embraer Paying $205 Million to Settle FCPA Charges

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-224

Washington D.C., Oct. 24, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a global settlement along with the U.S.
Department of Justice and Brazilian authorities that requires aircraft manufacturer Embraer S.A. to pay more than $205 million to resolve
alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

The SECâs complaint alleges that Embraer made more than $83 million in profits as a result of bribe payments from its U.S.-based subsidiary
through third-party agents to foreign government officials in the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia, and Mozambique. Embraer allegedly
created false books and records to conceal the illicit payments, and also engaged in an alleged accounting scheme in India.

According to the SECâs complaint, $3.52 million in bribes were paid to an official in the Dominican Republicâs air force to secure a military
aircraft contract in that country, and $1.65 million in bribes were routed to an official in Saudi Arabia to win business there. An alleged
$800,000 payment was made at the behest of a Mozambican government official as a condition of obtaining a contract with a state-owned
airline in that country. Approximately $5.76 million was allegedly paid to an agent in India in connection with the sale of three highly
specialized military aircraft for Indiaâs air force, and the payments were falsely recorded in Embraerâs books and records as part of a
consulting agreement that wasnât legitimate.

âAs alleged in our complaint, Embraer realized significant revenues by surreptitiously using third parties to mask bribes paid to government
officials with influence over contracts it was competing to win,â said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.

Kara N. Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit, added, âEmbraerâs alleged misconduct spanned multiple continents,
and it has taken significant ongoing coordination among international regulators and law enforcement agencies to uncover the companyâs
complex bribery schemes.â

Under the settlement, Embraer must pay a $107 million penalty to the Justice Department as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, and
more than $98 million in disgorgement and interest to the SEC. Embraer may receive up to a $20 million credit depending on the amount of
disgorgement it will pay to Brazilian authorities in a parallel civil proceeding in Brazil. Embraer must retain an independent corporate monitor
for at least three years.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Ernesto Palacios and Thierry Olivier Desmet of the FCPA Unit with assistance from Kathleen
Strandell. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service, the Brazilian Federal Police, Brazilâs Comissao de Valores Mobilidrios, the South
African Financial Services Board, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the Banco Central del Uruguay, the Spanish
ComisiÃ©6n Nacional del Mercado de Valores, and the French AutoritÃ© des MarchÃ©s Financiers.

",2016-224,--ERROR--,Embraer Paying $205 Million to Settle FCPA Charges.,"Washington D.C., Oct. 24, 2016 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a global settlement along with the U.S.
 Department of Justice and Brazilian authorities that requires aircraft manufacturer Embraer S.A. to pay more than $205 million to resolve alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

The SEC’s complaint alleges that Embraer made more than $83 million in profits as a result of bribe payments from its U.S.-based subsidiary through third-party agents to foreign government officials in the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia, and Mozambique. Embraer allegedly created false books and records to conceal the illicit payments, and also engaged in an alleged accounting scheme in India.

According to the SEC’s complaint, $3.52 million in bribes were paid to an official in the Dominican Republic’s air force to secure a military aircraft contract in that country, and $1.65 million in bribes were routed to an official in Saudi Arabia to win business there. An alleged $800,000 payment was made at the behest of a Mozambican government official as a condition of obtaining a contract with a state-owned airline in that country. Approximately $5.76 million was allegedly paid to an agent in India in connection with the sale of three highly specialized military aircraft for India’s air force, and the payments were falsely recorded in Embraer’s books and records as part of a consulting agreement that wasn’t legitimate.

“As alleged in our complaint, Embraer realized significant revenues by surreptitiously using third parties to mask bribes paid to government officials with influence over contracts it was competing to win,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.

SEC Charges Avon With FCPA Violations

Avon Entities to Pay $135 Million to Settle SEC and Criminal Cases

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-285

Washington D.C., Dec. 17, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global beauty products company Avon Products
Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by failing to put controls in place to detect and prevent payments and gifts to
Chinese government officials from employees and consultants at a subsidiary.

Avon entities agreed to pay a total of $135 million to settle the SECâs charges and a parallel case announced today by the U.S. Department of
Justice and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York.

The SEC alleges that Avon's subsidiary in China made $8 million worth of payments in cash, gifts, travel, and entertainment to gain access to
Chinese officials implementing and overseeing direct selling regulations in China. Avon sought to be among the first allowed to test the
regulations, and eventually received the first direct selling business license in China in March 2006. The improper payments also were made
to avoid fines or negative news articles that could have impacted Avonâs clean corporate image required to retain the license. Examples of
improper payments alleged in the SECâs complaint include paid travel for Chinese government officials within China or to the U.S. or Europe
as well as such gifts as Louis Vuitton merchandise, Gucci bags, Tiffany pens, and corporate box tickets to the China Open tennis tournament.

âAvon's subsidiary in China paid millions of dollars to government officials to obtain a direct selling license and gain an edge over their
competitors, and the company reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,â said Scott W. Friestad, an Associate Director in the SECâs
Division of Enforcement. âAvon missed an opportunity to correct potential FCPA problems at its subsidiary, resulting in years of additional
misconduct that could have been avoided.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the improper payments occurred from 2004
to 2008. Avon management learned about potential FCPA problems at the subsidiary through an internal audit report in late 2005. Avon
management consulted an outside law firm, directed that reforms be instituted at the subsidiary, and sent an internal audit team to follow
up. Ultimately, however, no such reforms were instituted at the Chinese subsidiary. Avon finally began a full-blown internal investigation in
2008 after its CEO received a letter from a whistleblower.

The SEC alleges that Avonâs books and records failed to accurately record the details and purpose of the payments. In some instances,
payments were concealed by falsely recording the transactions as employee business expenses or as reimbursement of a third-party vendor.
In other instances, the records for the payments set forth almost no detail at all. The resulting books and records did not allow a reviewer to
ascertain the government official or state-owned entities that received the payments or the purpose for which the payments were made.

The SECâs complaint charges Avon with violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Avon agreed to
pay disgorgement of $52,850,000 in benefits resulting from the alleged misconduct plus prejudgment interest of $14,515,013.13 for a total of
more than $67.36 million. In the parallel criminal matter, Avon entities agreed to pay $67,648,000 in penalties. Avon also is required to
retain an independent compliance monitor to review its FCPA compliance program for a period of 18 months, followed by an 18-month period
of self-reporting on its compliance efforts. Avon would be permanently enjoined from violating the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the federal securities laws. In reaching the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the SEC considered Avonâs
cooperation and significant remedial measures.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Paul W. Sharratt and Roger Paszamant and supervised by David Frohlich. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1445 / September
12, 2001

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ERIC L. MATTSON AND
JAMES W. HARRIS, Civil Action No. H-01-3106 (S.D. Tex.) (filed
September 11, 2001)

SEC SUES BAKER HUGHES INCORPORATED'S FORMER CHIEF
FINANCIAL OFFICER AND CONTROLLER FOR AUTHORIZING THE
PAYMENT OF A BRIBE

On September 11, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil
injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Texas, Houston Division, against Eric L. Mattson (""Mattson""), the former Chief
Financial Officer of Baker Hughes Incorporated (""Baker Hughes""), and James
W. Harris (""Harris""), Baker Hughes' former Controller. The Commission's
complaint alleges that Mattson and Harris authorized the payment of a bribe
of $75,000, through KPMG-Siddharta Siddharta & Harsono (""KPMG-SSH""),
Baker Hughes' agent and accountant in Indonesia, to a local government
official in Indonesia. Mattson and Harris directed that this payment be made
while knowing that KPMG-SSH would pass all or part of the payment along to
an Indonesian tax official for the purpose of influencing him to reduce a tax
assessment from $3.2 million to $270,000 for PT Eastman Christensen
(""PTEC""), an Indonesian company beneficially owned by Baker Hughes. This
improper payment was authorized in violation of the antibribery provisions of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"")

The complaint alleges that on March 9, 1999, Harris was told that an
Indonesian tax official was demanding a $75,000 payment, in exchange for
which he would reduce PTEC's tax assessment. Harris learned that KPMG-SSH
had offered to make the improper payment on PTEC's behalf using PTEC's
funds, and then issue an inflated invoice that would conceal the payment. The
complaint further alleges that Baker Hughes' FCPA advisor advised Harris that
any such payment to an Indonesian tax official would violate the FCPA. On
March 10, 1999, Harris told Baker Hughes' General Counsel and Mattson of
the Indonesian tax official's demand for an improper payment. During this
meeting, the General Counsel stated that the Indonesian tax official's
demands raised FCPA concerns and under no circumstances should Harris or
Mattson enter into any transaction that could potentially violate the FCPA. On
the evening of March 10, 1999, disregarding the FCPA advisor's instructions,
and acting contrary to the advice of the General Counsel, defendants Mattson
and Harris authorized the payment of the bribe to the Indonesian tax official.
The complaint alleges that Mattson and Harris violated Sections 30A(a) and
13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 promulgated
thereunder and aided and abetted Baker Hughes' violations of the books and
records and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)
(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).

Also on September 11, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Department of Justice filed a joint civil injunctive action in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division,
against KPMG-SSH and Sonny Harsono, a partner of KPMG-SSH, for their part
in the payment of the bribe to the Indonesian tax official. This is the first time
that the Commission and the Department of Justice, both of which have
jurisdiction over the antibribery provisions of the FCPA, have combined to file
a joint civil action. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the
complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of a Final Judgment
that permanently enjoins both defendants from violating and aiding and
abetting the violation of the antibribery provisions of the FCPA and the
internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") (Sections 104A(a)(1), (2) and (3) of
the FCPA and Sections 30A(a)(1), (2) and (3), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of
the Exchange Act). See Litigation Release No. 17127 (September 12, 2001).

Finally, in a related action, the Commission also instituted, on September 12,
2001, a settled administrative proceeding against Baker Hughes. The
Commission's Order finds that, in March 1999, Baker Hughes' CFO and its
Controller authorized the above-described illegal payment, through KPMG-
SSH, its agent in Indonesia, to a local government official in Indonesia. The
Order also finds that in 1998 and 1995, senior managers at Baker Hughes
authorized payments to Baker Hughes' agents in India and Brazil,
respectively, without making an adequate inquiry as to whether the agents
might give all or part of the payments to foreign government officials in
violation of the FCPA. Without admitting or denying the Commission's
findings, Baker Hughes consented to the entry of the Commission's Order.
The Order directs that Baker Hughes cease and desist from committing or
causing any violation and any future violation of the internal controls and
books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act). See Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 44784 (September 12, 2001); Accounting and Auditing
Enforcement Release No. 1447.

The Commission wishes to thank the United States Department of Justice for
its assistance in this matter.

SEC v. Jim Bob Brown, Civil Action No. 06-CV-2919, U.S.D.C./Southern
District of Texas (Houston Division)

SEC Charges Former Employee of A Willbros Group, Inc. Subsidiary
With FCPA Violations

Today, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission
or SEC) filed a civil action against Jim Bob ""J.B."" Brown, a former employee of
a subsidiary of Willbros Group, Inc., alleging that Brown violated and aided
and abetted violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), the prohibitions against circumventing internal controls
and falsifying records, and the books and records and internal controls
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Willbros
Group is a global provider of construction and engineering services in the oil
and gas industry. It has a class of securities that is registered under Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and that trades on the New York Stock Exchange.
Brown has agreed to settle the charges against him, without admitting or
denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint.

The Commission alleges in its complaint that Brown, a former supervisory
employee in Willbros's Nigerian and Latin American operations, participated in
three separate schemes to bribe foreign officials. First, the complaint alleges
that, in February and March 2005, Brown procured $1 million on behalf of a
Willbros affiliate and delivered that money as partial payment of previously-
made commitments to Nigerian government officials and to employees of the
operator of a joint venture majority owned by an arm of the Nigerian
government. He also assisted, according to the complaint, in the payment of
an additional $550,000 that was also used to satisfy the earlier commitments.
Second, Brown, in return for the granting to Willbros of a $3 million contract,
knowingly assisted a scheme to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil and
gas company owned by the government of Ecuador and its subsidiary. Finally,
Brown knowingly assisted a long-running scheme in which employees of
Willbros affiliates used fabricated invoices to procure cash from the
company's administrative headquarters in Houston that was used to, among
other things, bribe Nigerian tax and court officials.

The Commission alleges that, through these activities, Brown violated
Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.
In addition, the complaint alleges that Brown aided and abetted violations of
Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Exchange Act. Without
admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Brown consented to the
entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of
these provisions. Pursuant to the judgment, the Court will determine, at a
later date upon motion by the Commission, whether to order Brown to pay a
civil penalty and the amount of such penalty.

The Commission's investigation into the events underlying these violations is
ongoing. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of
Justice in the Commission's investigation.

SEC Charges Former CEO of Chilean-Based Chemical and Mining
Company With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2018-212

Washington D.C., Sept. 25, 2018 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that the former CEO of Chilean-based
chemical and mining company Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, S.A. (SQM) has agreed to pay $125,000 to resolve charges that he
violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

According to the SECâs order, over the course of seven years, SQM's then-CEO Patricio Contesse Gonzalez caused SQM to make nearly $15
million in improper payments to Chilean political figures and others connected to them. Last year, SQM paid $30 million to settle parallel civil
and criminal charges against the company.

The SECâs order against Contesse finds that he directed and authorized these improper payments through a discretionary CEO account. The
payments were supported by fake documentation submitted to SQM by individuals and entities posing as legitimate vendors. Contesse
caused the related false accounting entries in SQMâs books and records and also lied to SQMâs independent auditor and signed false
certifications in SQMâs filings.

âCorporate culture starts at the top, and when misconduct is directed by the highest level of management it is critical that they are held
accountable for their conduct,â said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

Contesse agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the findings in the SECâs order.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 21162 / July 31, 2009

SEC v. Nature's Sunshine Products, Inc., Douglas Faggioli and Craig
D. Huff, Case No. 09CV672 (D. Utah, Filed July 31, 2009)

SEC CHARGES NATURE'S SUNSHINE PRODUCTS, INC. WITH MAKING
ILLEGAL FOREIGN PAYMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a settled enforcement
against Nature's Sunshine Products Inc. (NSP), its Chief Executive Officer
Douglas Faggioli and its former Chief Financial Officer Craig D. Huff. According
to the SEC, the charges relate to cash payments made in 2000 and 2001 by
the Brazilian subsidiary of NSP, a manufacturer of nutritional and personal
care products, to import unregistered products into Brazil and the subsequent
falsification of its books and records to conceal the payments.

The complaint alleges that, faced with changes to Brazilian regulations which
resulted in classifying many of NSP's products as medicines, NSP's Brazilian
subsidiary made a series of cash payments to customs officials to import
product into that country and then purchased false documentation to conceal
the nature of the payments. It is alleged that this conduct violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, and the antifraud, issuer reporting, books and records
and internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint
also alleges that Faggioli and Huff, in their capacities as control persons,
violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the
securities laws in connection with the Brazilian cash payments. It is also
alleged that NSP failed to disclose the payments to Brazilian customs agents
in its filings with the Commission.

The civil injunctive action, which was filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Utah, alleges that NSP violated Sections 10(b), 13(a), 13(b)
(2)(A), 13(b)(2)(B) and 30A of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,
13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and that Faggioli and Huff violated Sections
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) as control persons pursuant to Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act.

NSP, Faggioli and Huff, without admitting or denying the allegations of the
complaint, have consented to the entry of final judgments that would enjoin
each of the defendants from future violations of the above-stated provisions
and would order NSP to pay a civil penalty of $600,000, and Faggioli and Huff
to each pay a civil penalty of $25,000.

Teva Pharmaceutical Paying $519 Million to Settle FCPA Charges

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2016-277

Washington D.C., Dec. 22, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited
has agreed to pay more than $519 million to settle parallel civil and criminal charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by
paying bribes to foreign government officials in Russia, Ukraine, and Mexico.

The SECâs complaint alleges that Teva made more than $214 million in illicit profits by making the influential payments to increase its market
share and obtain regulatory and formulary approvals as well as favorable drug purchase and prescription decisions.

âAs alleged in our complaint, Teva failed to devise and maintain proper internal accounting controls to prevent the companyâs payments of
bribes to win business in certain regions around the globe,â said Stephanie Avakian, Deputy Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.

Eric |. Bustillo, Director of the SECâs Miami Regional Office, added, âAs we allege in our complaint, many of these bribes were concealed as
legitimate payments to distributors. While distributors can help companies navigate complex regulatory environments and provide valuable
industry relationships, they also can create significant corruption risks for companies.â

Under the settlement, Teva must pay more than $236 million in disgorgement and interest to the SEC plus a $283 million penalty in a
deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Teva must retain an independent corporate monitor for at least three
years.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Jenny Trotman with assistance from Kathleen Strandell and Russell Koonin in the Miami Regional
Office. The case was supervised by Thierry Olivier Desmet of the FCPA Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Financial Services Commission of the British Virgin Islands.

Washington D.C., Dec. 16, 2019 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive Tim Leissner for engaging in a corruption scheme, by which he obtained millions of dollars by paying unlawful bribes to
various government officials to secure lucrative contracts for Goldman Sachs. Leissner has agreed to a settlement of the alleged violations of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) that includes a permanent bar from the securities industry.

According to the SEC's order, beginning in 2012, Leissner, as participating managing director of Goldman Sachs, used a third party
intermediary to bribe high-ranking government officials in Malaysia and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The order finds that these bribes enabled
Goldman Sachs to obtain lucrative business from 1Malaysia Development Berhard (1MDB), a Malaysian government owned investment fund,
including underwriting $6.5 billion in bond offerings. The order further finds that Leissner personally received more than $43 million in illicit
payments for his role in facilitating the bribe scheme.

""Individual conduct lies at the heart of all bribery schemes,"" said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. ""Here,
Leissner abused his leadership role at Goldman Sachs by engaging in a massive bribery scheme targeting the highest levels of two foreign
governments in order to bring in lucrative business to the firm and enrich himself.""

Leissner consented to the SEC's order finding that he violated the antibribery, internal accounting controls, and books and records provisions
of the federal securities laws and agreed to be permanently barred from the securities industry. The SEC's order requires Leissner to pay
disgorgement of $43.7 million, which will be offset by amounts paid pursuant to a forfeiture order as part of a resolution in a previously
instituted parallel criminal action by the U.S. Department of Justice.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric Heining and Paul G. Block of the FCPA Unit and Mark Albers and Martin Healey of the Boston
Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice Criminal Divisionâs Fraud and Money Laundering and Asset
Recovery Sections, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Monetary Authority of Singapore, Securities Commission of Malaysia, and the Securities
and Futures Commission of Hong Kong.

SEC Charges Orthofix International With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2012-133

Washington, D.C., July 10, 2012 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Texas-based medical device company Orthofix
International N.V. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when a subsidiary paid routine bribes referred to as âchocolatesâ to
Mexican officials in order to obtain lucrative sales contracts with government hospitals.

The SEC alleges that Orthofixâs Mexican subsidiary Promeca S.A. de C.V. bribed officials at Mexicoâs government-owned health care and social
services institution Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). The âchocolatesâ came in the form of cash, laptop computers, televisions, and
appliances that were provided directly to Mexican government officials or indirectly through front companies that the officials owned. The
bribery scheme lasted for several years and yielded nearly $5 million in illegal profits for the Orthofix subsidiary.

Orthofix agreed to pay $5.2 million to settle the SEC's charges.

âOnce bribery has been likened to a box of chocolates, you know a corruptive culture has permeated your business,â said Kara Novaco
Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. âOrthofixâs lax oversight allowed its subsidiary to
illicitly spend more than $300,000 to sweeten the deals with Mexican officials.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, the bribes began in 2003 and continued until
2010. Initially, Promeca falsely recorded the bribes as cash advances and falsified its invoices to support the expenditures. Later, when the
bribes got much larger, Promeca falsely recorded them as promotional and training costs. Because of the bribery scheme, Promecaâs training
and promotional expenses were significantly over budget. Orthofix did launch an inquiry into these expenses, but did very little to investigate
or diminish the excessive spending. Later, upon discovery of the bribe payments through a Promeca executive, Orthofix immediately self-
reported the matter to the SEC and implemented significant remedial measures. The company terminated the Promeca executives who
orchestrated the bribery scheme.

The SEC's proposed settlement is subject to court approval. Orthofix consented to a final judgment ordering it to pay $4,983,644 in
disgorgement and more than $242,000 in prejudgment interest. The final judgment would permanently enjoined the company from violating
the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. Orthofix also agreed to certain undertakings, including monitoring its
FCPA compliance program and reporting back to the SEC for a two-year period.

Orthofix also disclosed today in an 8-K filing that it has reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay a $2.22 million
penalty in a related action.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Carol Shau and Alka N. Patel in the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC acknowledges and
appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Criminal Division - Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20319 / October 1, 2007

Securities and Exchange Commission v. York International
Corporation, 07 CV 01750 (D.D.C.)(RCL)

SEC Files Settled Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges Against York
International Corporation For Improper Payments to UAE Officials, to
Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program, and to Others - - Company
Agrees to Pay Over $12 Million and to Retain an Independent
Compliance Monitor

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed anti-bribery, internal
controls, and books and records charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act against York International Corporation (""York International"") in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia. York International, a global provider
of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration products and
services, was acquired by Johnson Controls, Inc. in 2005. The Commission's
complaint alleges that York International's Delaware subsidiary paid
approximately $522,500 to an intermediary while knowing that most of the
money was intended to bribe United Arab Emirate officials; York
International's Dubai subsidiary authorized and made approximately
$647,110 in kickback payments under the U.N. Oil for Food Program; and that
York International's subsidiaries devised elaborate schemes to conceal
kickback payments of over $7.5 million made to secure orders on certain
commercial and government projects in the Middle East, India, China, Nigeria
and Europe.

According to the Commission's Complaint:

In 2003 and 2004, York International's Delaware subsidiary, York Air
Conditioning and Refrigeration, Inc. (""YACR"") paid approximately $522,500 to
an intermediary while knowing that most of the money was intended to bribe
United Arab Emirate officials to secure contracts in connection with the
construction of a government-owned luxury hotel called the Conference
Palace. Altogether, thirteen illicit payments were made on this project,
totaling $550,000.

In addition, from 2000 to 2003, York International's Dubai subsidiary
authorized and made approximately $647,110 in kickback payments in
connection with its sale of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the Oil for Food
Program (the ""Program""). Although the payments were characterized as
""after-sales service fees,"" no bona fide services were actually performed. The
Program provided humanitarian relief to the Iraqi population during the time
that Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions. The kickback payments
paid in connection with York International's subsidiary's sale of goods were
paid by a third party to Iraqi-controlled accounts in countries such as Jordan.

From 2001 through 2006, York International, through certain subsidiaries,
made over $7.5 million in illicit payments to secure orders on certain
commercial and government projects in the Middle East, India, China, Nigeria
and Europe. York International's subsidiaries devised elaborate schemes to
conceal kickback payments to certain individuals who had enough influence
to secure contracts for York International's subsidiaries. These payments were
referred to internally as ""consultancy payments,"" however, similar to the
payments made under the Oil for Food Program, no bona fide services were
performed. A total of 854 improper consultancy payments were made on
approximately 774 contracts -- 302 projects involved government end-users,
such as government owned companies, public hospitals, or schools.

York International violated the anti-bribery provision by paying bribes to UAE
officials to secure business. York International failed to devise and maintain
an effective system of internal controls to prevent or detect numerous
violations, as shown by: 1) the extent and duration of the illicit payment
schemes, 2) the involvement of multiple subsidiaries and numerous managers
and employees, and 3) the improper recording of these payments in the
books and records. York International failed to accurately record in its books
and records the kickbacks that were authorized for payment to Iraq, the
bribes in the UAE, and the illicit consultancy payments made in various
countries.

York International, without admitting or denying the allegations in the
Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment
permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A),
and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge
$8,949,132 in profits, plus $1,083,748 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a
civil penalty of $2,000,000. York International is also ordered to retain an
independent compliance monitor. York International will also pay a $10 million
fine pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department
of Justice, Fraud Section.

The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by York
International, which self-reported, and cooperation afforded the Commission
staff in its continuing investigation. The Commission acknowledges the
assistance of the Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations
Independent Inquiry Committee.

SEC Charges Total S.A. for Illegal Payments to Iranian Official

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2013-94

Washington, D.C., May 29, 2013 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged France-based oil and gas company Total S.A.
with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying $60 million in bribes to intermediaries of an Iranian government official who
then exercised his influence to help the company obtain valuable contracts to develop significant oil and gas fields in Iran.

The SEC alleges that Total made more than $150 million in profits through the bribery scheme. Total attempted to cover up the true nature of
the illegal payments by entering into sham consulting agreements with intermediaries of the Iranian official and mischaracterizing the bribes
in its books and records as legitimate âbusiness development expensesâ related to the consulting agreements. Total had inadequate systems
to properly review the consulting agreements and lacked sufficient internal controls to comply with federal laws prohibiting bribery.

Total, whose securities are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to pay more than $398 million to settle the SECâs
charges and a parallel criminal matter announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âTotal used illicit payments to win business in Iran, and reaped substantial financial benefits as a result,â said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of
the SECâs New York Regional Office. âTotal must now pay back all of its profits from the companyâs corrupt conduct and additionally pay
criminal penalties on top of that.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Total negotiated a development contract in 1995 with the
National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) for the countryâs Sirri A and E oil and gas fields. Prior to executing the contract, Total held a meeting
with the Iranian official and agreed to enter into a purported consulting agreement with an intermediary he designated. They agreed that
Total would make payments to the intermediary under the guise of a consulting agreement when the real purpose was to induce the Iranian
official to use his influence to help obtain NIOCâs approval of the development agreement. After the contract was executed, Total corruptly
made the bribery payments that resulted in NIOC allowing Total to develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields and make more than $150
million in profits.

The SECâs order requires Total to pay disgorgement of $153 million in illicit profits and retain an independent compliance consultant to review
and report on Totalâs compliance with the FCPA. Total also must cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of Section 30A,
Section 13(b)(2)(A), and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In the parallel criminal proceedings, Total agreed to pay a $245.2 million penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. Charges also
were recommended today by the prosecutor of Paris (Francois Molins, Procureur de la RÃ©publique) of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de
Paris for violations of French laws.

The SECâs investigation was led by Sharon Binger, Alex Janghorbani, and Barry OâConnell of the New York Regional Officeâs Enforcement
Division with significant assistance from the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit and the Department of Justiceâs Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section. The SEC also appreciates the assistance of French regulatory authorities.

Wire and Cable Manufacturer Settles FCPA and Accounting
Charges

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2016-283

Washington D.C., Dec. 29, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Kentucky-based General Cable
Corporation agreed to pay more than $75 million to resolve parallel SEC and U.S. Department of Justice investigations related to its violations
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The company agreed to pay an additional $6.5 million penalty to the SEC to settle separate
accounting-related violations.

According to the SECâs orders instituting settled administrative proceedings, General Cableâs overseas subsidiaries made improper payments
to foreign government officials for a dozen years to obtain or retain business in Angola, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Indonesia, and

Thailand. General Cableâs weak internal controls also failed to detect improper inventory accounting at its Brazilian subsidiary, causing the
company to materially misstate its financial statements from 2008 to the second quarter of 2012.

âGeneral Cable operated globally without the effective compliance programs and internal controls necessary to proactively address
corruption risks and accounting errors,â said Stephanie Avakian, Acting Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.

In the FCPA case, General Cable agreed to pay more than $55 million in disgorgement and interest to the SEC as well as a penalty of nearly
$20.5 million in a non-prosecution agreement announced today by the Justice Department. General Cable must self-report its FCPA
compliance efforts for the next three years. General Cable neither admitted nor denied the SECâs findings while agreeing to pay the $6.5
million penalty to settle the accounting violations. The SEC considered General Cable's self-reporting, cooperation, and remedial acts when
determining the settlements.

The SEC also charged Karl J. Zimmer, General Cableâs then-senior vice president responsible for sales in Angola. Zimmer agreed to pay a
$20,000 penalty without admitting or denying the SECâs findings that he knowingly circumvented internal accounting controls and caused
FCPA violations when he approved certain improper payments.

The SECâs investigation found no personal misconduct by General Cableâs former CEO Gregory B. Kenny and former CFO Brian J. Robinson,
who returned $3.7 million and $2.1 million in compensation received from the company during the period when the accounting violations
occurred. Therefore, it wasnât necessary for the SEC to pursue a clawback action under Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The SECâs investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Rachel Nonaka, Mark Oh, Colin Rand, Eric Hubbs, David Johnson, and
Olivia Choe. The case is being supervised by Anita Bandy, Kristen Dieter, and Bridget Fitzpatrick. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the
U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Portuguese Securities Market Commission.

Cease-and-Desist Order and a Civil Money Penalty (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Il.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission finds that:

Summary

1. Ball Corporation, an Indiana corporation based in Broomfield Colorado, is
a manufacturer of metal packaging for beverages, foods and household products. From
July 2006 through October 2007, Ball, through its Argentine subsidiary Formametal,
S.A., offered and paid at least ten bribes, totaling at least $106,749, to employees of the
Argentine government to secure the importation of prohibited used machinery and the
exportation of raw materials at reduced tariffs.

2. Although certain accounting personnel at Ball learned soon after Ball
acquired Formametal in March 2006 that Formametal employees may have made
questionable payments and caused other compliance problems before the acquisition, the
Company failed to take sufficient action to ensure that such activities did not recur at
Formametal after Ball took control of the Argentine company. Within months of Ballâs
acquisition of Formametal, two Formametal executivesâthe then-Formametal President
and then-Formametal Vice President of Institutional Affairs (hereinafter the âPresidentâ
and âVice President of Institutional Affairs,â respectively )âauthorized improper
payments to Argentine officials. The true nature of the payments was mischaracterized
as ordinary business expenses on Formametalâs books and records and went undetected
for Over a year.

Respondent

3. In addition to supplying metal cans to food, beverage, and household
products customers, Ball Corporation provides aerospace and other technological services
to commercial and governmental customers. The Company employs approximately
14,000 people in more than ninety locations worldwide. Its stock is registered pursuant
to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the ticker symbol BLL. Ballâs Form 10-K for the period ending December 31,
2009, reported consolidated net income of $387.9 million on revenue of $7.34 billion.
Ball acquired Argentine company Formametal, S.A., on March 27, 2006, as part of an
acquisition of a larger U.S. aerosol container business. Formametal, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Ball, manufactures aerosol cans. Formametalâs financial results are
reported on a consolidated basis in Ballâs financial statements.
Facts

A. Formametal Made or Offered Unlawful Payments to Officials of the
Argentine Government

4. In June 2006, approximately three months after Ball acquired Formametal,
a financial analyst in the general accounting group for Ballâs Metal Food and Household
Packaging Products Division made a routine visit to the newly acquired subsidiary to
gather information about its operations. During the course of his visit, the analyst
discovered that Formametalâs employees may have made questionable payments and
caused other compliance problems in the past. Concerned that such activity could recur
at Formametal in the future, the analyst included his findings in a report (âthe
Formametal Reportâ) that he submitted to the director of accounting of Ballâs Metal Food
and Household Packaging Products Division. The Formametal Report highlighted prior
infractions by Formametal, including questionable customs fees, used machinery being
declared new to circumvent customs regulations, other dishonest customs declarations,
and the destruction of documents. Although Ball had demoted Formametalâs incumbent
President and replaced the Chief Financial Officer after acquiring the subsidiary in March
2006, when the Formametal Report came to the attention of several senior executives in
Ballâs Metal Food and Household Packaging Products Division, Ballâs actions were not
sufficient to prevent future infractions by Formametal executives.

5. In the period between July 2006 and October 2007, and following the
analystâs discoveries, Formametalâs senior officers authorized at least ten unlawful
payments totaling approximately $106,749 to Argentine government officials. Some
payments were specifically authorized by Formametalâs President, while in other
instances, he appeared to have been aware that the unlawful payments were occurring and
acquiesced to them. In some instances, the President learned about the opportunity to
make a bribe from the Vice President of Institutional Affairs, who would then make the
arrangements for the bribe without providing details to the President. These payments
were disguised to appear as legitimate business expenses in Formametalâs books and
records and included in Ballâs consolidated financial results reported for fiscal year 2006
and the first three quarters of 2007. These improper payments are explained below.

B. Equipment Import

6. Formametal paid bribes totaling over $100,000 in 2006 and 2007 to secure
the importation of equipment for use in its manufacturing process. Formametalâs
President authorized at least two of these payments. In most cases, the bribes were paid
to induce government customs officials to circumvent Argentine laws prohibiting the
importation of used equipment and parts. The bribes often appeared on invoices from a
non-governmental customs agent for Formametal. The payments were invoiced as
separate line items described inaccurately as âfees for customs assistance,â âcustoms
advisory services,â âverification charge,â or simply âfees,â were invoiced in addition to
other customs-related fees, and were sometimes in rounded peso amounts. To further
obscure that the payments were really bribes, Formametal posted the payments
inaccurately identified as âcustoms adviceâ or âprofessional feesâ to an âOther Expensesâ
account or in some instances to an account named for the related equipment.

C. Copper Scrap Export Waiver

7. Formametal paid a bribe that its President authorized in October 2007 in
an attempt to bypass high government duties imposed on copper scrap exports. These
duties, which were generally 40 percent of the value of the copper, were imposed by
Argentina in an effort to discourage export sales of domestically produced copper and
copper scraps. The President estimated the additional profit from exporting this copper
scrap with the export duty waivers versus selling it inside Argentina would be
approximately $1.5 million annually.

8. For six months prior to August 2007, Formametal unsuccessfully sought
to gain government approval to export the scrap without the customarily high duties.
After giving up on obtaining the waiver legitimately, on October 18, 2007, Formametal
disbursed $4,821, representing the first of five bribe installments authorized by its
President to obtain an export duty waiver. The payment was funneled through
Formametalâs third party customs agent. Obscuring that the transaction was a bribe,
Formametal inaccurately recorded the payment as âAdvice fees for temporary
merchandise exportedâ in an âOther Expensesâ account. Although the President believed
that the payments were requested by a customs official and would result in a copper scrap
export duty waiver, no copper scrap export shipments were made pursuant to the
improper payment.

D. Ball Accountants Learn About One Bribe

9. As early as February 2007, two accountants in Ballâs Metal Food and
Household Packaging Products Division learned about one of the bribes paid by
Formametal to import machinery for use in its manufacturing process. Formametalâs
Vice President of Institutional Affairs, an Argentine national, who was formerly president
and owner of the subsidiary, had paid the bribe on behalf of Formametal out of his own
funds and received reimbursement from Formametal in the form of a company car.
Formametal initially booked the transfer of the car as an interest expense. After being
pressed for details about the transaction, Formametalâs President revealed to the two Ball
accountants that the car was reimbursement for a bribe paid by the Vice President of
Institutional Affairs. Although Formametal subsequently changed the accounting to
record the transfer of the car as a miscellaneous expense, it still failed to accurately
describe the âtransferâ as a reimbursement for an illegal payment made to Argentine
customs officials.
E. Ball Failed to Establish Sufficient Internal Accounting Controls

10. Ballâs and Formametalâs weak internal controls, which included importing
equipment into Argentina in 2006 and 2007 without appropriate invoices and
documentation, made it difficult to detect that the subsidiary was repeatedly violating
Argentine law through the payment of bribes. Ballâs weak internal controls also factored
into the Companyâs failure to prevent further abuses at Formametal, after Ball
accountants learned of a bribe paid by Formametal to import machinery for use in its
manufacturing process. As a result, Formametal continued to make improper payments
during 2007.

11. Further, Ball lacked sufficient internal controls to bring about effective
changes after information available to Ballâs executives indicated anti-bribery
compliance problems at Formametal. For example, key personnel responsible for dealing
with customs officials remained at Formametal, even though external due diligence
performed on Formametal suggested that Formametal officials may have previously
authorized questionable payments.

Legal Analysis

12. The FCPA, enacted in 1977, added Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) to
require public companies to make and Keep books, records, and accounts, which, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the issuer. It also added Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B) to require such
companies to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that transactions: (1) are executed in accordance with
managementâs general or specific authorization; and (11) are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted

accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain
accountability for assets. 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 78m(b)(2)(A) and 78m(b)(2)(B).

13. As detailed above, Formametal failed to properly record illegal payments
and transactions when it repeatedly paid bribes disguised as customs assistance on
invoices from its customs agent. In addition, Formametal used a customs agent as an
intermediary to obscure the source and destination of funds, and it created false or
misleading journal entries to facilitate the illegal importation of used machinery into
Argentina. Ultimately, the improper payments, as well as the book value of the car given
as reimbursement for a bribe paid by Formametalâs Vice President of Institutional Affairs
were mischaracterized as ordinary business expenses on Formametalâs books and
records. Because Formametalâs financial statements were consolidated with those of
Ball, Ball failed to keep accurate books and records in violation of Exchange Act Section
13(b)(2)(A).

14. In violation of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(B), Ball also failed to
devise and maintain an effective system of internal controls to prevent and detect
violations of the FCPA at Formametal, even after senior Ball officers were on notice in
mid-2006 that in the past Ballâs subsidiaryâs employees had made questionable payments
and caused other compliance problems.

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Parker Drilling Company,
Civil Action No. 1:13CV461 (E.D. Va., April 16, 2013)

SEC Charges Parker Drilling Company with Violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Parker Drilling
Company, a worldwide drilling services and project management firm, with
violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by authorizing improper
payments to a third-party intermediary retained to assist the company in
resolving customs disputes.

The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia,
alleges that in 2004 Parker Drilling authorized payments to a Nigerian agent
totaling $1.25 million. The company did so despite former senior executives
knowing that the agent intended to use the funds to ""entertain"" Nigerian
officials involved in resolving Parker Drilling's ongoing customs problems.
Following the Nigerian agent's work, the company received an unexplained
$3,050,000 reduction of a previously assessed customs fine, and the
company was permitted to nationalize and sell its Nigerian rigs.

To settle the SEC's charges, Parker Drilling will pay disgorgement of
$3,050,000 plus pre-judgment interest of $1,040,818. Parker Drilling
consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from
violating Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. The
proposed settlement is subject to court approval.

In the parallel criminal proceedings, the Department of Justice entered into a
Deferred Prosecution Agreement with Parker Drilling in which the company
will pay an $11,760,000 penalty.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice's Fraud
Section, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Kingdom's Crown
Prosecution Service and Metropolitan Police Service.

SEC Charges Multinational Telecommunications Company With
FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2019-254

Washington D.C., Dec. 6, 2019 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Sweden-based Telefonaktiebolaget LM
Ericsson was charged with engaging in a large-scale bribery scheme involving the use of sham consultants to secretly funnel money to
government officials in multiple countries. The bribes netted Ericsson hundreds of millions in profits. To resolve these alleged violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) and charges from a parallel criminal investigation, Ericsson has agreed to pay more than $1 billion to the
SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice and to install an independent compliance monitor.

The SECâs complaint alleges that from 2011 through 2017, Ericsson subsidiaries obtained business valued at approximately $427 million by
using third parties to bribe officials in Saudi Arabia, China, and Djibouti. As alleged, Ericsson also had third parties pay for lavish trips and
entertainment for government officials or their family members. In exchange for the bribes, Ericsson received lucrative contracts from state-
owned telecommunications entities in these countries. The complaint alleges that Ericssonâs subsidiaries further violated the FCPA in
Vietnam, Indonesia and Kuwait, by maintaining slush funds, using code names, and creating sham transactions and invoices.

âAs we allege in our complaint, Ericsson engaged in an egregious bribery scheme for years, spanning multiple continents, by surreptitiously
using slush funds and funneling money through sham intermediaries,â said Steve Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. âThe
remedial measures required by our settlement, including the appointment of an independent compliance monitor, reflect the Commissionâs
commitment to preventing these serious violations of our laws.â

Michele Wein Layne, Director of the SECâs Los Angeles Regional Office, added, âTodayâs settled action seeks to hold Ericsson accountable for
the profit it obtained as a result of these unlawful bribes and ensure that robust remedial compliance measures are put into place.â

The SEC's complaint alleges that Ericsson violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the federal
securities laws. Ericsson agreed to pay more than $539 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to settle the SECâs charges. To
resolve parallel criminal charges by the DOJ, Ericsson agreed to pay a $520 million criminal penalty and enter into a deferred-prosecution
agreement. An Ericsson subsidiary, Ericsson Egypt, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Ericsson
must retain an independent compliance monitor for at least three years.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Wendy E. Pearson and Carol Kim of the Los Angeles Regional Office under the supervision of Finola
H. Manvelian. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the DOJâs Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York

FCPA Violations.,"Washington D.C., Dec. 6, 2019 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Sweden-based Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson was charged with engaging in a large-scale bribery scheme involving the use of sham consultants to secretly funnel money to government officials in multiple countries.

Securities & Exchange Commission v. AGCO Corporation, Civil Action
No. 1:09-CV-01865 (D.D.C.)(RMU)

SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges
Against AGCO Corporation For Improper Payments to Iraq Under the
U.N. Oil for Food Program â AGCO Agrees to Pay Over $18.3 Million
in Disgorgement, Interest, and Penalties

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against AGCO
Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. AGCO
Corporation, headquartered in Duluth, Georgia, is a manufacturer and
supplier of agricultural equipment. The Commissionâs complaint alleges that
from 2000 through 2003, certain AGCO subsidiaries made approximately $5.9
million in kickback payments in connection with their sales of equipment to
lraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the âProgramâ). The
kickbacks were characterized as âafter sales service feesâ (âASSFsâ), but no
bona fide services were performed. The Program was intended to provide
humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship
under international trade sanctions. The Program required the Iraqi
government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account;
however, AGCOâs subsidiariesâ kickbacks diverted funds out of the escrow
account and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in Jordan.

According to the Commissionâs Complaint:

Prior to the Oil for Food Program, AGCO tried unsuccessfully to increase its
market share in Iraq. AGCOâs U.K. subsidiary, AGCO Ltd., marketed and
negotiated the sale of agricultural equipment to Iraqi ministries. In December
2000, AGCO Ltd.âs business manager for Iraq learned from its Jordanian agent
that the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture was demanding a kickback of ten percent
of the contract value as a condition to awarding contracts to AGCO. The
business manager and his supervisor agreed to the kickbacks, and the agent
agreed to make the payments on AGCOâs behalf. The agent asked AGCO to
set up bank guarantees in favor of the agent to facilitate the payments. Ina
December 2000 e-mail, the agent stated that âthe payments are in the
âinterest of continuity of our solid position we are enjoying now.ââ

The fees AGCO normally paid to the agent were: (1) a flat rate commission;
(2) a variable commission based upon the value of the equipment sold; and
(3) an âAfter Salesâ commission to allow the agent to establish and maintain
an infrastructure in Iraq to support AGCOâs farm machinery. However,
beginning in early 2001, AGCO paid additional amounts to the agent to make
the kickbacks. To conceal the scheme, AGCOâs employees created a fictional
account in its books and records denoted as âMinistry Accrual.â The kickbacks
were recorded in this account. The AGCO employees made it appear that the
account was being used to pay the agent for his After Sales commissions.
Thus, AGCO maintained and used two accounts, both of which were described
as for the purpose of After Sales work.

The accrual account was created by AGCO Ltd.âs marketing staff with virtually
no oversight from AGCO Ltd.âs finance department. No one questioned the
existence of the dual accounts. No one questioned why the Ministry Accrual
account contained approximately ten percent of the contract value despite
the fact that there was no contract in place requiring that such ten percent be
paid to the ministry or anyone else. Unlike other payments to the agent, the
Ministry Accrual payments were made by bank guarantee and in French
francs or Euros instead of U.S. dollars. Marketing and finance employees in
the U.K., Denmark, and France were all instrumental in the scheme. As part of
the scheme, AGCOâs subsidiaries concealed the kickback payments from the
UN by secretly inflating UN contract prices by an artificial ten percent.
Altogether, AGCOâs subsidiaries paid approximately $5,912,393 in ASSFs on
sixteen contracts. The ASSFs were inaccurately described as a âMinistry
Accrualâ for infrastructure repair in the companyâs books and records and
were included among legitimate commission payments to AGCOâs agent in
Iraq.

On at least two occasions, the Jordanian agent asked for and received funds
for âcar paymentsâ related to business in Iraq, and AGCO employees did not
obtain any documentation as to the appropriateness of these expenses or ask
if the cars were going to government officials. In October 2002, an employee
who set up bank guarantees for the agent knowing that the payments would
be forwarded to the ministry warned AGCO Ltd. that âwe do not want the
auditors raising any questions on Iraq business!â In February 2002, AGCOâs
internal auditors noted numerous problems with AGCO Ltd.âs sales process,
including the establishment of accrual accounts by the marketing
department. However, AGCO failed to conduct a review of the accrual
accounts that existed at the time of the report, and the Ministry Accrual
account continued to be used in the scheme to make and record additional
ASSF payments to Iraq. One AGCO Ltd. accounting employee described the
Finance Department employees as âblind loadersâ who input information into
AGCOâs books without any adequate oversight role. AGCOâs legal department
was aware that the company was conducting sales under the Program into
lrag, a sanctioned country, but failed to ensure that the sanctions or the UN
rules and regulations were followed. In fact, AGCOâs General Counsel's office
assisted on at least one occasion with obtaining 661 Committee approval for
an Oil for Food contract. The General Counsel's office then sent a letter to a
London bank asking that money be paid to the Jordanian agent.

AGCO failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and
prevent the payments and AGCOâs accounting for these transactions failed
properly to record the nature of the payments. AGCO, without admitting or
denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint, consented to the
entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining AGCO from future violations
of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and ordering AGCO to disgorge $13,907,393 in profits plus $2,000,000 in pre-
judgment interest plus a civil penalty of $2,400,000. AGCO will also pay a
$1,600,000 penalty pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement with the
U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. AGCO will also enter into a criminal
disposition in which the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious Economic Crime
will confiscate over $600,000.

The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by AGCO and
the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its
investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the
Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations Independent
Inquiry Committee.

34-87055-s,"SEC Charges Global Oil and Gas Services Company with
Violations of the FCPA

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-19493

September 19, 2019 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced the institution of settled cease and desist proceedings
against TechnipFMC plc, a global oil and gas services company, for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by FMC Technologies
prior to its 2017 merger with Technip S.A.

The SECâs order finds that FMC Technologies used a Monaco-based intermediary to bribe Iraqi government officials in order to obtain
contracts to provide metering technologies for oil and gas production measurement to Iraqi state owned oil companies. As stated in the
order, FMC paid the intermediary without evidence of services rendered, allowed the intermediary to use subagents and success-fee based
compensation without adequate due diligence, and falsely characterized the payments in its books and records. The order also finds that
FMC failed to properly assess and manage its anti-corruption risks and devoted insufficient resources to compliance concerning its business
dealings in Iraq.

The SECâs order finds that TechnipFMC violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of Sections
30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting the findings, TechnipFMC consented to a cease-
and-desist order and agreed to pay disgorgement of $4,327,194 and prejudgment interest of $734,712 and to comply with certain
undertakings, including self-reporting for three years. The SEC took into consideration the companyâs cooperation and remediation in
determining whether to accept TechnipFMCâs offer of settlement.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Akita N. Adkins and Maria F. Boodoo of the SECâs FCPA Unit and supervised by David Reece and
Tracy L. Price. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, the U.K. Serious Fraud
Office, and Monaco authorities.

SEC Charges Former Panasonic Executives

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2018-290

Washington D.C., Dec. 18, 2018 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former senior executives of the U.S.
subsidiary of Panasonic Corp. with knowingly violating the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal
securities laws and causing similar violations by the parent company.

According to the SECâs order against Paul A. Margis, then-CEO and president of Panasonic Avionics Corp., Margis used a third party to pay
over $1.76 million to several consultants, including a government official who was offered a lucrative consulting position to assist Panasonic
Avionics in obtaining and retaining business from a state-owned airline. Panasonic Avionics falsely recorded these payments, and Margis
circumvented company procedures for engaging the consultants, who provided few, if any services. Margis also made materially false or
misleading statements to Panasonic Avionicsâ auditor regarding the adequacy of Panasonic Avionicsâ internal accounting controls and
accuracy of the companyâs books and records.

According to the SECâs order against Takeshi âTyroneâ Uonaga, then-CFO of Panasonic Avionics, Uonaga caused Panasonic Corp. to
improperly record $82 million in revenue based on a backdated contract and made false representations to Panasonic Avionicsâ auditor
regarding financial statements, internal accounting controls, and books and records.

âHolding individuals accountable, particularly senior executives, is critical,â said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SECâs Enforcement
Division. âCompliance starts at the top and senior executives who fail in their duty to comply with the federal securities laws will be held
responsible.â

The SECâs orders require Margis and Uonaga to pay penalties of $75,000 and $50,000, respectively. The order against Uonaga also suspends
him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits
of public companies. The order permits Uonaga to apply for reinstatement after five years. Margis and Uonaga consented to the entry of their

",2018-290,--ERROR--,SEC Charges Former Panasonic Executives.,"Washington D.C., Dec. 18, 2018 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two former senior executives of the U.S.
 subsidiary of Panasonic Corp. with knowingly violating the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws and causing similar violations by the parent company.

According to the SEC’s order against Paul A. Margis, then-CEO and president of Panasonic Avionics Corp., Margis used a third party to pay over $1.76 million to several consultants, including a government official who was offered a lucrative consulting position to assist Panasonic Avionics in obtaining and retaining business from a state-owned airline. Panasonic Avionics falsely recorded these payments, and Margis circumvented company procedures for engaging the consultants, who provided few, if any services. Margis also made materially false or misleading statements to Panasonic Avionics’ auditor regarding the adequacy of Panasonic Avionics’ internal accounting controls and accuracy of the company’s books and records.

According to the SEC’s order against Takeshi “Tyrone” Uonaga, then-CFO of Panasonic Avionics, Uonaga caused Panasonic Corp. to improperly record $82 million in revenue based on a backdated contract and made false representations to Panasonic Avionics’ auditor regarding financial statements, internal accounting controls, and books and records.

“Holding individuals accountable, particularly senior executives, is critical,” said Antonia Chion, Associate Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division. “Compliance starts at the top and senior executives who fail in their duty to comply with the federal securities laws will be held responsible.”
The SEC’s orders require Margis and Uonaga to pay penalties of $75,000 and $50,000, respectively. The order against Uonaga also suspends him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant, which includes not participating in the financial reporting or audits of public companies. The order permits Uonaga to apply for reinstatement after five years. Margis and Uonaga consented to the entry of their orders without admitting or denying the findings.

In April of this year, the Commission instituted a related settled cease-and-desist proceeding against Panasonic Corp. finding that it violated the anti-bribery, anti-fraud, books and records, internal accounting controls, and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20671 / August 6, 2008
SEC v. Ali Hozhabri, Civil Action No. 08 CV 1359 (D.D.C.)

SEC Charges Former ABB Project Manager for Falsifying Company's
Books and Records

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it filed a
settled civil action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia against Ali Hozhabri, a former project manager for a subsidiary of
ABB Ltd., charging him with violations of the books and records provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act""). ABB is a Swiss
corporation, and its American Depository Receipts are registered with the
Commission and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

As alleged in the complaint, Hozhabri was a project manager for ABB Network
Management (""ABB NM""), a division of a U.S. based ABB subsidiary, which
provides products and services for managing power generation and
transmission networks. The Commission alleges that, from 2002 through
2004, Hozhabri fraudulently submitted approximately $468,714 in cash and
check disbursement requests to ABB NM for purported business expenses
associated with projects in Brazil, Paraguay, and the United Arab Emirates. As
alleged in the complaint, these purported expenses were phony, and
inaccurately recorded as legitimate business expenses in ABB's books and
records. The Commission further alleges that the funds disbursed by ABB NM
as a result of these requests were not used to pay any business expenses, but
rather were embezzled by Hozhabri and the former General Manager of ABB
NM. According to the complaint, Hozhabri personally kept $234,357 of the
embezzled funds.

The Commission alleges that Hozhabri violated Section 13(b)(5) of the
Exchange Act, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and aided and abetted violations
of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act. Without admitting or denying the
allegations in the complaint, Hozhabri consented to the entry of a final
judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these
provisions, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains of $234,357, which
will be deemed satisfied by his payment of that amount in a pending criminal
case by the U.S. Department of Justice. In that case, United States v.
Hozhabri, Criminal Docket No. H-07-452(s) (SDTx), Hozhabri has pled guilty to
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and is awaiting sentencing.

The Commission wishes to thank the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation for their assistance in connection with this
matter.

The Commission's investigation is continuing.

34-88679-s,"SEC Charges Eni S.p.A. with FCPA Violations

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-19751

April 17, 2020 - The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Eni S.p.A., an Italian multinational oil and gas company
whose ADRs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to settle charges that it violated the books and records and internal
accounting controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with an improper payment scheme in Algeria by Eni's
43% minority-owned and controlled subsidiary at the time, Saipem S.p.A. Eni is a recidivist, having been previously charged by the SEC in
2010 for violating the same FCPA provisions in connection with a bribery scheme in Nigeria by its then-wholly-owned subsidiary Snamprogetti
Netherlands, B.V.

According to the SEC's order, Saipem entered into four sham contracts with an intermediary between 2007 and 2010 to assist in obtaining
contracts awarded by Algeria's state-owned oil company. The order finds that Saipem paid approximately â¬198 million to the intermediary,
which directed a portion of the money to Algerian government officials or their designees. The order finds that Sapiem was awarded at least
seven contracts from the Algerian state-owned oil company. According to the order, Eni, which at the time consolidated Saipem's financial
statements into its own, failed to accurately record the true nature of the intermediary payments in its books and records. The order also
finds that a former senior executive at Saipem orchestrated the scheme at Saipem and, after he was hired to be the CFO of Eni, continued to
facilitate Saipem's improper payments to the intermediary. As a result of the former executive's misconduct at Eni, the company failed to
satisfy its good faith obligations to use its influence to cause Saipem to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls
consistent with statutory requirements.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Eni has consented to the entry of an order to cease and desist from violating the books and
records and internal accounting controls provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, and has agreed to pay $24.5
million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Delane Olson and Michael Brennan and supervised by Ansu N. Banerjee, Assistant Regional
Director, and Melissa R. Hodgman, Associate Director. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section;
the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office; and the Italian Commissione Nazionale Per Le Societa E La Borsa

SEC Charges Johnson & Johnson With Foreign Bribery

J&J to Pay $70 Million to Settle Cases Brought by SEC and Criminal
Authorities

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-87

Washington, D.C., April 7, 2011 - The Securities and Exchange Commission

today charged Johnson and Johnson (J&J) with violating the Foreign Corrupt

Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing public doctors in several European countries
and paying kickbacks to Iraq to illegally obtain business.

The SEC alleges that since at least 1998, subsidiaries of the New Brunswick,
N.J.-based pharmaceutical, consumer product, and medical device company
paid bribes to public doctors in Greece who selected J&J surgical implants,
public doctors and hospital administrators in Poland who awarded contracts to
J&J, and public doctors in Romania to prescribe J&| pharmaceutical products.
J&J subsidiaries also paid kickbacks to Iraq to obtain 19 contracts under the
United Nations Oil for Food Program.

Â» SEC Complaint
Â» Litigation Release No. 21922

 

J&J agreed to settle the SECâs charges by paying more than $48.6 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest. J&J also agreed to pay a $21.4
million fine to settle parallel criminal charges announced by the U.S.
Department of Justice (DOJ) today. A resolution of a related investigation by
the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office is anticipated.

âThe message in this and the SECâs other FCPA cases is plain - any
competitive advantage gained through corruption is a mirage,â said Robert
Khuzami, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. âJ&J chose profit
margins over compliance with the law by acquiring a private company for the
purpose of paying bribes, and using sham contracts, off-shore companies, and
slush funds to cover its tracks.â

Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act Unit, added, âBribes to public doctors can have a detrimental
effect on the public health care systems that potentially pay more for
products procured through greed and corruption.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in the District of
Columbia, public doctors and administrators in Greece, Poland, and Romania
who ordered or prescribed J&J products were rewarded in a variety of ways,
including with cash and inappropriate travel. J&J subsidiaries, employees and
agents used slush funds, sham civil contracts with doctors, and off-shore
companies in the Isle of Man to carry out the bribery.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, J&J has consented to the
entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934; ordering it to pay $38,227,826 in disgorgement and $10,438,490 in
prejudgment interest; and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings
regarding its FCPA compliance program. J&J voluntarily disclosed some of the
violations by its employees and conducted a thorough internal investigation
to determine the scope of the bribery and other violations, including proactive
investigations in more than a dozen countries by both its internal auditors and
outside counsel. J&Jâs internal investigation and its ongoing compliance
programs were essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of J&Jâs
FCPA violations.

Kelly G. Kilroy and Tracy L. Price of the Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit and
Brent S. Mitchell and Reid A. Muoio conducted the SECâs investigation. The
SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud

Kingdom; and 5th Investigation Department of the Regional Prosecutor's

SEC Charges Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. with FCPA Violations

September 20, 2016 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Provo,
Utah-based Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (Nu Skin US) has agreed to pay $765,688 to settle charges
that it violated the internal controls and books-and-records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA violations arose from a payment its Chinese subsidiary, Nu
Skin (China) Daily Use & Health Products Co. Ltd. (Nu Skin China), made to a charity to obtain
the influence of a high-ranking Chinese Communist party official to impact an on-going
provincial agency investigation.

An SEC investigation found that in 2013, Nu Skin China was under investigation by a provincial
branch of the Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC) concerning Nu Skin Chinaâs
compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to direct selling in China. Following the
AICâs initial investigation, the AIC informed Nu Skin China that it had gathered enough
information to support violations against the company and it was threatening to impose an RMB
2.8 million fine which, at the time, equated approximately $431,088.

The SEC investigation also found that certain personnel of Nu Skin China made a decision to
request that the party official personally intervene in the AIC matter in return for Nu Skin China
making an RMB | million donation to a charity identified by the party official. The party official
was associated with the entity that was responsible for establishing the charity in the province.
Further, the provincial head of the AIC had previously reported to the party official. Following
the donation ceremony, a Nu Skin China employee suggested contacting the party official to
request that Nu Skin China not be named or fined by the AIC and internal emails reflected that
Nu Skin China believed that such action was âcrucial for us to settle this... peacefully.â Two
days later, Nu Skin China received notice of the AICâs final decision in which the company was
neither charged nor fined.

The SECâs order finds that Nu Skin US violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Nu Skin US agreed to a
cease-and-desist order and to pay disgorgement of $431,088, prejudgment interest of $34,600,
and a civil money penalty in the amount of $300,000.

In determining to accept the offer, the SEC considered cooperation that Nu Skin US afforded to
the SEC staff and the remedial acts undertaken by Nu Skin US.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Kimberly Greer and Lee Robinson of the Denver
Regional Office, and supervised by Ian Karpel.

Walmart Charged With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2019-102

Washington D.C., June 20, 2019 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Walmart with violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) by failing to operate a sufficient anti-corruption compliance program for more than a decade as the retailer experienced
rapid international growth.

Walmart agreed to pay more than $144 million to settle the SECâs charges and approximately $138 million to resolve parallel criminal
charges by the U.S. Department of Justice for a combined total of more than $282 million.

According to the SECâs order, Walmart failed to sufficiently investigate or mitigate certain anti-corruption risks and allowed subsidiaries in
Brazil, China, India, and Mexico to employ third-party intermediaries who made payments to foreign government officials without reasonable
assurances that they complied with the FCPA. The SECâs order details several instances when Walmart planned to implement proper
compliance and training only to put those plans on hold or otherwise allow deficient internal accounting controls to persist even in the face of
red flags and corruption allegations.

âWalmart valued international growth and cost-cutting over compliance,â said Charles Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA
Unit. âThe company could have avoided many of these problems, but instead Walmart repeatedly failed to take red flags seriously and
delayed the implementation of appropriate internal accounting controls.â

Walmart consented to the SECâs order finding that it violated the books and records and internal accounting controls provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Jason Rose, Irene Gutierrez, and Laura Bennett. The case was supervised by David Reece. The

SEC Charges Tyson Foods with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-42

Washington, D.C., Feb. 10, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Tyson Foods Inc. with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) by making illicit payments to two Mexican government
veterinarians responsible for certifying its Mexican subsidiaryâs chicken
products for export sales.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 21851
Â» SEC Complaint

 

The SEC alleges that Tyson de Mexico initially concealed the improper
payments by putting the veterinariansâ wives on its payroll while they
performed no services for the company. The wives were later removed from
the payroll and payments were then reflected in invoices submitted to Tyson
de Mexico by one of the veterinarians for âservices.â Tyson de Mexico paid
the veterinarians a total of $100,311. It was not until two years after Tyson
Foods officials first learned about the subsidiaryâs illicit payments that its
counsel instructed Tyson de Mexico to cease making the payments.

Tyson Foods agreed to pay more than $5 million to settle the SECâs charges
and resolve related criminal proceedings announced today by the Department
of Justice.

âTyson and its subsidiary committed core FCPA violations by bribing
government officials through no-show jobs and phony invoices, and by having
a lax system of internal controls that failed to detect or prevent the
misconduct,â said Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of
Enforcement.

According to the SECâs complaint filed in federal court in the District of
Columbia, the scheme occurred during fiscal years 2004 to 2006. In order to
export products, meat-processing facilities in Mexico must obtain certification
through an inspection program administered by Mexicoâs federal government
and supervised by an office in the Mexican Department of Agriculture. Tyson
de Mexico participated in the program in order to export goods to Japan and
other countries. The two veterinarians involved were responsible for certifying
Tyson de Mexicoâs chicken products for export and served as official Mexican
government veterinarians at Tyson de Mexicoâs facilities.

The SECâs complaint alleges that a Tyson de Mexico plant manager
discovered the wives on the payroll in June 2004 and informed a Tyson Foods
accountant of the situation. After subsequent meetings involving Tyson Foods
and Tyson International officials, the payroll payments to the veterinariansâ
wives were replaced with invoice payments to one of the veterinarians. An
executive of Tyson International approved this approach.

The SEC alleges that in connection with these improper payments, Tyson
Foods failed to keep accurate books and records and failed to implement a
system of effective internal controls to prevent the salary payments to
phantom employees and the payment of illicit invoices. The improper
payments were improperly recorded as legitimate expenses in Tyson de
Mexicoâs books and records and included in Tyson de Mexicoâs reported
financial results for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006. Tyson de Mexicoâs
financial results were, in turn, a component of Tyson Foodsâ consolidated
financial statements filed with the SEC for those years.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, Tyson Foods consented to
the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement plus pre-judgment
interest of more than $1.2 million and permanently enjoining it from violating
the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the
FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval.

In a related criminal information filed today, the Department of Justice
charged Tyson Foods with conspiring to violate the FCPA and violating the
FCPA. DOJ and Tyson Foods agreed to resolve the charges by entering into a
deferred prosecution agreement. Tyson Foods has agreed to pay a $4 million
criminal penalty.

The SECâs case was investigated by Allen Flood and Conway Dodge of the
SECâs Division of Enforcement. The SEC acknowledges the cooperation of
Tyson Foods in the investigation. The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the
assistance of the U.S. Department of Justiceâs Fraud Section and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

Mobile TeleSystems Settles FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2019-27

Washington D.C., March 6, 2019 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Russian telecommunications provider
Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS) will pay $100 million to resolve SEC charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) to win
business in Uzbekistan.

According to the SECâs order, MTS bribed an Uzbek official who was related to the former President of Uzbekistan and had influence over the
Uzbek telecommunications regulatory authority. During the course of the scheme, MTS made at least $420 million in illicit payments for the
purpose of obtaining and retaining business. The payments enabled MTS to enter the telecommunications market in Uzbekistan and operate
there for eight years, during which it generated more than $2.4 billion in revenues. In 2012, the Uzbek government expropriated MTSâs
Uzbek operations. As further described in the SECâs order, the bribes were funneled to front companies controlled by the Uzbek official and
were disguised in MTSâs books as acquisition costs, option payments, purchases of regulatory assets, and charitable donations.

âThe company engaged in egregious misconduct for nearly a decade, secretly funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to a corrupt official.
Building business on a foundation of bribery leaves the business and American investor interests at the mercy of corrupt officials,â said
Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

MTS consented to the SECâs order finding that it violated the anti-bribery, books and records and internal accounting control provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and requiring it to pay a $100 million penalty. In a related matter, MTS has entered into a deferred
prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and its subsidiary has pleaded guilty in federal court, and has agreed to pay a
criminal fine and forfeiture in the amount of $850 million. The Department is crediting the $100 million penalty that MTS is paying to the
SEC. The company must also retain an independent compliance monitor for at least three years.

This is the third case brought by the SEC and the Department of Justice involving public companies operating in the Uzbek
telecommunications market. Taken as a whole, these actions have led to the recovery by U.S. and foreign authorities of $2.6 billion.

The Commission greatly appreciates the cooperation and assistance of the Department of Justice Criminal Divisionâs Fraud and Money
Laundering and Asset Recovery Sections, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the Prosecution Authority of
the Netherlands, the National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime in Norway (@KOKRIM), the
Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland, and the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau in
Latvia. Valuable assistance was also provided by regulatory and law enforcement colleagues in the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland,
including the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, the Bermuda Monetary Authority,

SEC Charges Alcatel-Lucent with FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-258

Company to Pay More Than $137 Million to Settle SEC and DOJ
Charges

Washington, D.C., Dec. 27, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged Paris-based telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent, S.A.
with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to

foreign government officials to illicitly win business in Latin America and Asia.

The SEC alleges that Alcatelâs subsidiaries used consultants who performed
little or no legitimate work to funnel more than $8 million in bribes to
government officials in order to obtain or retain lucrative telecommunications
contracts and other contracts. Alcatel agreed to pay more than $45 million to
settle the SECâs charges, and pay an additional $92 million to settle criminal
charges announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice.

âAlcatel and its subsidiaries failed to detect or investigate numerous red flags
suggesting their employees were directing sham consultants to provide gifts
and payments to foreign government officials to illegally win business,â said
Robert Khuzami, Director of the SECâs Division of Enforcement. âAlcatelâs
bribery scheme was the product of a lax corporate control environment at the
company.â

Glenn S. Gordon, Associate Director for Enforcement in the SECâs Miami
Regional Office, added, âThe serious sanctions Alcatel has agreed to,
including paying back all net profits made on the contracts Alcatel illegally
obtained, should serve as a reminder that we are committed to enforcing the
FCPA and a level playing field for companies seeking to obtain or retain
business in other countries.â

According to the SECâs complaint filed in the Southern District of Florida,
Alcatelâs bribes went to government officials in Costa Rica, Honduras,
Malaysia, and Taiwan between December 2001 and June 2006. An Alcatel
subsidiary provided at least $14.5 million to consulting firms through sham
consulting agreements for use in the bribery scheme in Costa Rica. Various
high-level government officials in Costa Rica received at least $7 million of
the $14.5 million to ensure Alcatel obtained or retained three contracts to
provide telephone services in Costa Rica.

The SEC alleges that the same Alcatel subsidiary bribed officials in the
government of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications
contracts. Another Alcatel subsidiary made bribery payments to Malaysian
government officials in order to procure a telecommunications contract. An
Alcatel subsidiary also made illegal payments to various officials in the
government of Taiwan to win a contract to supply railway axle counters to the
Taiwan Railway Administration.

According to the SECâs complaint, all of the bribery payments were
undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting fees in the books of
Alcatelâs subsidiaries and then consolidated into Alcatelâs financial
statements. The leaders of several Alcatel subsidiaries and geographical
regions, including some who reported directly to Alcatelâs executive
committee, either knew or were severely reckless in not knowing about the
misconduct.

The SECâs complaint charges that Alcatel violated Section 30A of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by making illicit payments to foreign
government officials, through its subsidiaries and agents, in order to obtain or
retain business. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act by
failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and prevent the
payments. Alcatel violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act by
improperly recording the payments in its books and records. Alcatel violated
Section 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act when its subsidiaries knowingly failed to
implement a system of internal controls and knowingly falsified their books
and records to camouflage bribes as consulting payments. Without admitting
or denying the SECâs allegations, Alcatel has consented to a court order
permanently enjoining it from future violations of these statutory provisions;
ordering the company to pay $45.372 million in disgorgement of wrongfully
obtained profits, and ordering it to comply with certain undertakings including
an independent monitor for a three-year term. The settlement is subject to
court approval.

The SECâs case was investigated by Ernesto Palacios and Thierry Olivier
Desmet of the Division of Enforcementâs FCPA Unit and by Teresa J. Verges
and Fernando Torres - all of the Miami Regional Office.

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3348 / December
20, 2011

Securities and Exchange Commission vs. Aon Corporation, Civil
Action No. 1:11-cv-02256 (D.D.C.) (filed Dec. 20, 2011)

SEC FILES SETTLED FCPA CHARGES AGAINST AON CORPORATION

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a settled enforcement
action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Aon
Corporation (Aon), an Illinois-based global provider of risk management
services, insurance and reinsurance brokerage, alleging violations of the
books and records and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA). Aon will pay a total of approximately $14.5 million in
disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC. In a related action, Aon
will pay a $1.764 million criminal fine to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

The Commissionâs complaint alleges that Aonâs subsidiaries made over $3.6
million in improper payments to various parties between 1983 and 2007 asa
means of obtaining or retaining insurance business in those countries. The
complaint alleges that some of the improper payments were made directly or
indirectly to foreign government officials who could award business directly to
Aon subsidiaries, who were in position to influence others who could award
business to Aon subsidiaries, or who could otherwise provide favorable
business treatment for the companyâs interests. The complaint alleges that
these payments were not accurately reflected in Aonâs books and records,
and that Aon failed to maintain an adequate internal control system
reasonably designed to detect and prevent the improper payments.

According to the Commissionâs complaint, the improper payments made by
Aonâs subsidiaries fall into two general categories: (i) training, travel, and
entertainment provided to employees of foreign government-owned clients
and third parties; and (ii) payments made to third-party facilitators. Aon
subsidiaries made these payments in various countries around the world,
including Costa Rica, Egypt, Vietnam, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates,
Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The complaint alleges that Aon realized over
$11.4 million in profits from these improper payments.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commissionâs complaint,
Aon consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from
future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act
and ordering the company to pay disgorgement of $11,416,814 in profits,
together with prejudgment interest thereon of $3,128,206, for a total of
$14,545,020. Aonâs proposed settlement offer has been submitted to the
court for its consideration. In a related criminal proceeding, DOJ announced
today that Aon has entered into a non-prosecution agreement under which
the company will pay a $1.764 million criminal fine for the misconduct. Aon
cooperated with the Commission's and DO]âs investigations and implemented
remedial measures during the course of the investigations.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Fraud Section of DO]âs
Criminal Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial
Services Authority of the U.K. in this matter.

SEC Charges Consumer Loan Company With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2020-177

Washington D.C., Aug. 6, 2020 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that World Acceptance Corporation, a South
Carolina-based consumer loan company, has agreed to pay $21.7 million to resolve charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA).

The SECâs order finds that from at least December 2010 through June 2017, World Acceptance Corporationâs former Mexican subsidiary, WAC
de Mexico S.A. de C.V., paid more than $4 million in bribes to Mexican government officials and union officials to secure the ability to make
loans to government employees and ensure that those loans were repaid in a timely manner. According to the SECâs order, WAC Mexico paid
the bribes in a variety of ways, including by depositing money into bank accounts linked to the officials and by hiring an intermediary to
distribute large bags of cash among the officials. The SECâs order finds that these bribes were inaccurately recorded in World Acceptance
Corporationâs books and records as legitimate business expenses. The SECâs order further finds that World Acceptance Corporation lacked
internal accounting controls sufficient to detect or prevent the payments of such bribes and that management lacked the appropriate tone at
the top regarding internal audit and compliance, thereby undermining the effectiveness of those functions.

âThis long-running bribe scheme did not happen in a vacuum. Through a lack of adequate internal accounting controls and a culture that
undermined its internal audit and compliance functions, World Acceptance Corporation created the perfect environment for illicit activity to
occur for nearly a decade,â said Charles E. Cain, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs findings, World Acceptance Corporation consented to the entry of an order requiring that the
company cease and desist from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and pay $17.826
million in disgorgement, $1.9 million in prejudgment interest, and a $2 million penalty.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Jennifer T. Calabrese of the FCPA Unit and supervised by Ansu N. Banerjee. The SEC appreciates
the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New

SEC Charges Alcoa With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2014-3

Washington D.C., Jan. 9, 2014 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged global aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. with violating
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when its subsidiaries repeatedly paid bribes to government officials in Bahrain to maintain a key
source of business.

An SEC investigation found that more than $110 million in corrupt payments were made to Bahraini officials with influence over contract
negotiations between Alcoa and a major government-operated aluminum plant. Alcoaâs subsidiaries used a London-based consultant with
connections to Bahrainâs royal family as an intermediary to negotiate with government officials and funnel the illicit payments to retain
Alcoaâs business as a supplier to the plant. Alcoa lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the bribes, which were improperly
recorded in Alcoaâs books and records as legitimate commissions or sales to a distributor.

Alcoa agreed to settle the SECâs charges and a parallel criminal case announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice by paying a total of
$384 million.

âAs the beneficiary of a long-running bribery scheme perpetrated by a closely controlled subsidiary, Alcoa is liable and must be held
responsible,â said George Canellos, co-director of the SEC Enforcement Division. âIt is critical that companies assess their supply chains and
determine that their business relationships have legitimate purposes.â

Kara N. Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit added, âThe extractive industries have historically been exposed to a
high risk of corruption, and those risks are as real today as when the FCPA was first enacted.â

According to the SECâs order instituting settled administrative proceedings, Alcoa is a global provider of not only primary or fabricated
aluminum, but also smelter grade alumina - the raw material that is supplied to plants called smelters that produce aluminum. Alcoa refines
alumina from bauxite that it extracts in its global mining operations. From 1989 to 2009, one of the largest customers of Alcoaâs global
bauxite and alumina refining business was Aluminium Bahrain B.S.C. (Alba), which is considered one of the largest aluminum smelters in the
world. Alba is controlled by Bahrainâs government, and Alcoaâs mining operations in Australia were the source of the alumina that Alcoa
supplied to Alba.

According to the SECâs order, Alcoaâs Australian subsidiary retained a consultant to assist in negotiations for long-term alumina supply
agreements with Alba and Bahraini government officials. A manager at the subsidiary described the consultant as âwell versed in the normal
ways of Middle East businessâ and one who âwill keep the various stakeholders in the Alba smelter happy...â Despite the red flags inherent in
this arrangement, Alcoaâs subsidiary inserted the intermediary into the Alba sales supply chain, and the consultant generated the funds
needed to pay bribes to Bahraini officials. Money used for the bribes came from the commissions that Alcoaâs subsidiary paid to the
consultant as well as price markups the consultant made between the purchase price of the product from Alcoa and the sale price to Alba.

The SECâs order finds that Alcoa did not conduct due diligence or otherwise seek to determine whether there was a legitimate business
purpose for the use of a middleman. Recipients of the corrupt payments included senior Bahraini government officials, members of Albaâs
board of directors, and Alba senior management. For example, after Alcoaâs subsidiary retained the consultant to lobby a Bahraini
government official, the consultantâs shell companies made two payments totaling $7 million in August 2003 for the benefit of the official.
Two weeks later, Alcoa and Alba signed an agreement in principle to have Alcoa participate in Albaâs plant expansion. In October 2004, the
consultantâs shell company paid $1 million to an account for the benefit of that same government official, and Alba went on to reach another
supply agreement in principle with Alcoa. Around the time that agreement was executed, the consultantâs companies made three payments
totaling $41 million to benefit another Bahraini government official as well.

The SECâs cease-and-desist order finds that Alcoa violated Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Alcoa will pay $175 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, of which $14 million will be satisfied by the companyâs payment of forfeiture in
the parallel criminal matter. Alcoa also will pay a criminal fine of $209 million.

The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice as well as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, Australian Federal Police, Ontario Securities Commission, Guernsey Financial Services Commission,
Liechtenstein Financial Market Authority, Norwegian @KOKRIM, United Kingdom Financial Control Authority, and Office of the Attorney General

According to the SEC’s order, Alcoa’s Australian subsidiary retained a consultant to assist in negotiations for long-term alumina supply agreements with Alba and Bahraini government officials. A manager at the subsidiary described the consultant as “well versed in the normal ways of Middle East business” and one who “will keep the various stakeholders in the Alba smelter happy...” Despite the red flags inherent in this arrangement, Alcoa’s subsidiary inserted the intermediary into the Alba sales supply chain, and the consultant generated the funds needed to pay bribes to Bahraini officials. Money used for the bribes came from the commissions that Alcoa’s subsidiary paid to the consultant as well as price markups the consultant made between the purchase price of the product from Alcoa and the sale price to Alba.

The SEC’s order finds that Alcoa did not conduct due diligence or otherwise seek to determine whether there was a legitimate business purpose for the use of a middleman. Recipients of the corrupt payments included senior Bahraini government officials, members of Alba’s board of directors, and Alba senior management. For example, after Alcoa’s subsidiary retained the consultant to lobby a Bahraini government official, the consultant’s shell companies made two payments totaling $7 million in August 2003 for the benefit of the official.
 Two weeks later, Alcoa and Alba signed an agreement in principle to have Alcoa participate in Alba’s plant expansion. In October 2004, the consultant’s shell company paid $1 million to an account for the benefit of that same government official, and Alba went on to reach another supply agreement in principle with Alcoa. Around the time that agreement was executed, the consultant’s companies made three payments totaling $41 million to benefit another Bahraini government official as well.

The SEC’s cease-and-desist order finds that Alcoa violated Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 Alcoa will pay $175 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, of which $14 million will be satisfied by the company’s payment of forfeiture in the parallel criminal matter. Alcoa also will pay a criminal fine of $209 million.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 21357 / December 31, 2009

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 3093 / December
31, 2009

Securities and Exchange Commission v. UTStarcom, Inc., Case No.
CV-09-6094 (JSW) (N.D. Cal. filed Dec. 31, 2009)

SEC CHARGES CALIFORNIA TELECOM COMPANY WITH BRIBERY AND
OTHER FCPA VIOLATIONS

The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Alameda, Calif.-
based telecommunications company UTStarcom, Inc. with violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for authorizing unlawful payments to
foreign government officials in Asia.

UTStarcom agreed to settle the SEC's charges and pay a $1.5 million penalty
among other remedies. In a related criminal case, the U.S. Department of
Justice announced today that UTStarcom agreed to pay an additional $1.5
million fine.

The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, alleges that UTStarcom's wholly-owned subsidiary in China paid
nearly $7 million between 2002 and 2007 for hundreds of overseas trips by
employees of Chinese government-controlled telecommunications companies
that were customers of UTStarcom, purportedly to provide customer training.
In reality, the trips were entirely or primarily for sightseeing.

The SEC further alleges that UTStarcom provided lavish gifts and all-expenses
paid executive training programs in the U.S. for existing and potential foreign
government customers in China and Thailand. UTStarcom also purported to
hire individuals affiliated with foreign government customers to work in the
U.S. and provided them with work visas, when in reality the individuals did no
work for UTStarcom. According to the SEC, UTStarcom also made improper
payments to sham consultants in China and Mongolia while knowing that they
would pay bribes to foreign government officials.

The SEC's complaint charges UTStarcom with violations of the anti-bribery,
books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA (Sections 30A,
13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
respectively). UTStarcom agreed, without admitting or denying the charges,
to the entry of a permanent injunction against FCPA violations and to provide
the SEC with annual FCPA compliance reports and certifications for four years,
in addition to paying the $1.5 million penalty.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice during the
investigation.

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Ingersoll-Rand Company Ltd.,
Civil Action No. 107- CV- 01955 (D.D.C.) (JDB)

SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges
Against Ingersoll-Rand Company Ltd. For Improper Payments to Iraq
Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program - - Company Agrees to Pay Over
$4.2 Million and to Make Certain Undertakings Regarding its Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act Compliance Program

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against
Ingersoll-Rand Company Ltd., a New Jersey-based industrial equipment
company, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The
Commission's complaint alleges that from 2000 through 2003, four of
Ingersoll-Rand's subsidiaries entered into contracts in which $963,148 in
kickback payments were made and $544,697 in additional payments were
authorized in connection with sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the
U.N. Oil for Food Program (the ""Program""). The kickbacks were characterized
as ""after-sales service fees"" (""ASSFs""), but no bona fide services were
performed. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the
Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade
sanctions. It allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods
through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by Ingersoll-Rand's
subsidiaries and third parties diverted funds out of the escrow account and
into an Iraqi slush fund. The contracts submitted to the U.N. did not disclose
that the illicit payments were included in the inflated contract prices. The
complaint also alleges that $8,000 in ""pocket money"" and travel expenses
were paid to Iraqi government officials in connection with a trip to Italy.

According to the Commission's Complaint:

Ingersoll-Rand's German subsidiary ABG entered into six Program contracts
involving kickback payments of $718,637. In November 2000, shortly after an
ABG salesman negotiated two contracts in Baghdad, the office of Ingersoll-
Rand's Chairman received an anonymous fax alerting the company to the
kickback arrangement. Ingersoll-Rand initiated an investigation and
questioned the salesman, who admitted to agreeing to pay back $292,578 to
the Iraqi Ministry. ABG attempted to go forward with the contracts with some
disclosure to the U.N. that money was going back to Iraq. However, the U.N.
advised that the payments were not allowed and the contracts were never
concluded. Ingersoll-Rand did not withdraw from the Program and failed to
conduct appropriate due diligence to prevent the payment of ASSFs on other
Program contracts. Indeed, in the following year, ABG negotiated four
additional contracts. These were distributorship agreements, in which ABG
sold its products to intermediaries that ABG knew would resell them into Iraq.
Ingersoll-Rand either knew or was reckless in not knowing that the
distributors made, or agreed to make, a total of $426,059 in kickback
payments on the four contracts.

Ingersoll-Rand's subsidiary I-R Italiana entered into four Program contracts
involving a total of $474,302 in ASSF payments. To conceal the kickbacks, I-R
Italiana increased the payment due on each contract by 10% and created a
fictitious line item on its purchase orders to justify the extra payment. I-R
Italiana entered into two side letters with Iraq to pay the ASSFs, which were
not disclosed to the U.N. In one of the side letters, I-R Italiana stated explicitly
that the fictitious purchase order description used to conceal the kickback did
not represent an actual performance obligation on I-R Italiana's part. In
February 2002, I-R Italiana sponsored eight officials from the Iraqi Oil Ministry
to spend two days touring a manufacturing facility in Italy. According to
internal e-mail messages, the Iraqi officials spent two additional days ""on
holiday"" touring Florence at the company's expense, and were also given
$8,000 in ""pocket money.""

Ingersoll-Rand's Irish subsidiary Thermo-King signed a side agreement with an
Iraq Ministry to make an ASSF payment of $53,919, which was not disclosed
to the U.N. The contract failed to receive U.N. approval for unrelated reasons.
Ingersoll-Rand's Belgian subsidiary I-R Benelux sold products to a Jordanian
third party, which I-R Benelux knew would sell the equipment into Iraq at a
70% markup. I-R Benelux shipped the goods to Iraq and obtained all the
necessary export control licenses. The third party, when questioned by the
U.N. Independent Inquiry Committee, subsequently confirmed that it had
made the ASSF payment.

Ingersoll-Rand knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments were
either offered or paid in connection with all of these transactions. Ingersoll-
Rand failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and
prevent the payments. Ingersoll-Rand's accounting for these transactions
failed properly to record the nature of the company's payments, and
characterized some ASSFs as ""sales deductions"" or ""other commissions"".

Ingersoll-Rand, without admitting or denying the allegations in the
Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment
permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge
$1,710,034 in profits, plus $560,953 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a
civil penalty of $1,950,000. Ingersoll-Rand is also ordered to comply with
certain undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program. Ingersoll-Rand
will also pay a $2,500,000 fine pursuant to a deferred prosecution agreement
with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section.

The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Ingersoll-
Rand and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its
investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the
Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations Independent
Inquiry Committee.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20835 / December 22, 2008

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Fiat S.p.A. and CNH Global
N.V., Civil Action No. 08 CV 0221 (D.D.C.) (CKK)

SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges
Against Fiat S.p.A. and CNH Global N.V. For Improper Payments to
Iraq Under the U.N. Oil for Food Program â Fiat Agrees to Pay Over
$10 Million in Disgorgement, Interest, and Penalties

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against Fiat
S.p.A. and CNH Global N.V. in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia. Fiat S.p.A., an Italian company, provides automobiles, trucks and
commercial vehicles. CNH Global N.V., a majority-owned subsidiary of Fiat,
provides agricultural and construction equipment. The Commission's
complaint alleges that from 2000 through 2003, certain Fiat and CNH Global
subsidiaries made approximately $4.3 million in kickback payments in
connection with their sales of humanitarian goods to Iraq under the United
Nations Oil for Food Program (the ""Program""). The kickbacks were
characterized as ""after sales service fees"" (""ASSFs""), but no bona fide services
were performed. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for
the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade
sanctions. The Program required the Iraqi government to purchase
humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by
Fiat's and CNH Global's subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account
and into Iraqi-controlled accounts at banks in countries such as Jordan.

According to the Commission's Complaint:

During the Oil for Food Program, Fiat's subsidiary, IVECO S.p.A., used its
IVECO Egypt office to enter into four direct contracts with Iraqi ministries in
which $1,803,880 in kickbacks were made on the sales of commercial
vehicles and parts. After agreeing to pay the ASSFs, IVECO Egypt increased its
agent's commissions from five percent to between fifteen and twenty percent
of the total U.N. contract price, which the agent funneled to Iraq as kickbacks.
The agent submitted invoices for the inflated commissions, and IVECO
financial documents show line items for ""contract pay-back"" due to the agent.
IVECO and the agent secretly inflated the U.N. contracts by ten to fifteen
percent. Despite the agent's invoices being held for one year and the
unusually large commissions, IVECO paid the invoices. In one instance, IVECO
set up a bank guarantee in the amount of the ASSF in favor of a Dubai-based
firm that operated as a front company for Iraq. IVECO's bank guarantee was
canceled and, instead, the agent established an identical bank guarantee to
conceal IVECO's role. A line item identified as ""pay-back"" on IVECO documents
corresponded to the amount of the agent's bank guarantee. The ASSFs were
incorrectly recorded as legitimate commissions on the company's books and
records.

Beginning in November 2000, IVECO changed its method of doing business for
future contracts by making the agent its distributor. As a distributor, the
agent purchased equipment directly from IVECO for its own account, and in
turn, the agent sold IVECO trucks and parts to Iraq under its own inflated
contracts to the U.N. With IVECO's knowledge, the agent facilitated
$1,364,080 in ASSFs on twelve additional contracts. Through this mechanism,
IVECO was able to move its goods into Iraq, but keep itself distanced from any
involvement in the ASSF scheme. IVECO knew or should have known from its
direct sales to Iraq that the agent's sales of IVECO products included ASSFs. In
correspondence with the U.N., the agent conceded that it paid ASSFs on the
contracts and confirmed that the payments were made through Al Rafidain
Bank.

In mid-2001, CNH Global subsidiary Case France engaged in three direct
transactions with Iraqi ministries in which $187,720 in kickbacks were made
on the sale of construction equipment. Armed Iraqi officials approached Case
France's Baghdad facility reiterating its request for kickbacks. Case France
then entered into a side letter agreeing to pay kickbacks. The side letter was
not disclosed to the U.N. To generate funds to pay the kickbacks and to
conceal the ASSFs, Case France and its agent secretly inflated the U.N.
contracts by approximately ten percent. Case France inflated its commission
payments to its distributor, who then forwarded the excess funds to Iraq as
kickbacks. Case France did not record the kickbacks on its books and records.

Between December 2000 and May 2001, CNH Global subsidiary New Holland
engaged in two direct transactions with Iraqi ministries in which $447,116 in
kickbacks were made on the sale of tractors. To generate funds to pay the
kickbacks and to conceal the ASSFs, New Holland secretly inflated the U.N.
contracts by approximately ten percent. On one contract, New Holland
obtained a bank guarantee in favor of the Iraqi ministry in the amount of the
ASSF. The ASSFs were recorded as cost of goods sold in New Holland's books
and records. Soon after the two direct contracts were negotiated, New
Holland ceased entering into direct sales to Iraq. After an Iraqi official inquired
why the company no longer conducted business in Iraq, New Holland resumed
its business but in a manner that distanced itself from the ASSFs. New Holland
made its dealer a distributor, which allowed the dealer to purchase New
Holland goods for the dealer's own account. The dealer, in turn, then sold New
Holland products to Iraq under the dealer's own secretly inflated U.N.
contracts. A November 2001, correspondence from the dealer to New Holland
discussed the fact that New Holland's direct sales to Iraq remain impracticable
as long as the ""famous 10"" (a reference to the ten percent kickback) was
required, and showed the dealer could make the payment rather than New
Holland. With New Holland's knowledge, the dealer facilitated ASSF payments
totaling $576,861 to Iraq on three U.N. contracts. An additional $312,198
ASSF payment on a fourth contract was authorized, but never received by
Iraq.

Fiat and CNH Global failed to maintain adequate systems of internal controls
to detect and prevent the payments and their accounting for these
transactions failed properly to record the nature of the payments. Fiat and
CNH Global, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's
complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining
Fiat and CNH Global from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)
(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and ordering Fiat to disgorge
$5,309,632 in profits plus $1,899,510 in pre-judgment interest plus a civil
penalty of $3,600,000. Fiat will also pay a $7,000,000 penalty pursuant to a
deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud
Section. The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by
Fiat and CNH Global and the cooperation the companies afforded the
Commission staff in its investigation. The Commission acknowledges the
assistance of the Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations
Independent Inquiry Committee.

SEC Charges Former CEO of Innospec for Role in Bribery
Scheme

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2011-21

Washington, D.C., Jan. 24, 2011 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged a former chief executive officer at Innospec, Inc., with violating
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by approving bribes to government
officials to obtain and retain business.

The SEC alleges that Paul W. Jennings learned of the company's longstanding
practice of paying bribes to win orders for sales of tetraethyl lead (TEL) in
mid- to late 2004 while serving as the CFO. After becoming CEO in 2005,
Jennings and others in Innospec's management approved bribery payments to
officials at the Iraqi Ministry of Oil (MoO) in order to sell the fuel additive to
lraq refineries. Innospec used its third-party agent in Iraq to funnel payments
to Iraqi officials.

 

Additional Materials
Â» SEC Complaint

 

Jennings agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him. The SEC previously
charged Innospec as well as its former TEL business director and its agent in
Iraq with FCPA violations.

""This is the third enforcement action against an individual responsible for the
widespread bribery that occurred at Innospec,"" said Cheryl J. Scarboro, Chief
of the SEC's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Unit. ""We will vigorously hold
accountable those individuals who approve such bribery and who sign false
SOX certifications and other documents to cover up the wrongdoing.""

According to the SEC's complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, Jennings played a key role in Innospec's bribery activities in Iraq
and Indonesia. Innospec, a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and
other specialty chemicals, was charged last year for making illicit payments of
approximately $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit
payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian
government officials in exchange for contracts worth approximately $176
million.

The SEC alleges that Innospec made payments totaling more than $1.6 million
and promised an additional $884,480 to MoO officials. For example, in an
October 2005 e-mail copying Jennings, the agent said that Iraqi officials were
demanding a 2 percent kickback and that ""[W]e are sharing most of our
profits with Iraqi officials. Otherwise, our business will stop and we will lose
the market. We have to change our strategy and do more compensation to
get the rewards."" The kickback and later payments were paid by increasing
the agent's commission, which Jennings approved. The SEC's complaint also
alleges that Jennings was aware of the scheme to pay an official at the Trade
Bank of Iraq in exchange for a favorable exchange rate on letters of credit.
Another scheme involved a bribe to ensure the failure of a field test of a
competitor product. A confidential MoO report for the field trial test was
shared with Jennings. Bribes were offered to secure a 2008 Long Term
Purchase Agreement that would have caused approximately $850,000 to be
shared with Iraqi officials. The agreement, however, did not go forward due to
the investigation and ultimate discovery by U.S. regulators of widespread
bribery by Innospec.

According to the SEC's complaint, Innospec also paid bribes to Indonesian
government officials from at least 2000 to 2005 in order to win contracts
worth more than $48 million from state-owned oil and gas companies in
Indonesia. Jennings became aware of and approved payments beginning in
mid to late 2004. Various euphemisms to refer to the bribery were commonly
used in e-mails and in discussions with Jennings and others at Innospec,
including ""the Indonesian Way,"" ""the Lead Defense Fund,"" and ""TEL
optimization."" Bribery discussions were held on a flight in the U.S. and even
discussed at Jennings' performance review in 2005. In one bribery scheme
with Pertamina, an Indonesian state owned oil and gas company, Innospec
agreed, with approval by Jennings, to a ""one off payment"" of $300,000 to
their Indonesian Agent with the understanding that it would be passed on to
an Indonesian official.

The SEC's complaint also alleges that from 2004 to February 2009, Jennings
signed annual certifications that were provided to auditors where he falsely
stated that he had complied with Innospec's Code of Ethics incorporating the
Company's FCPA policy. Jennings also signed annual and quarterly personal
certifications pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in which he made
false certifications concerning the company's books and records and internal
controls.

Jennings has consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations,
to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating
Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules
13a-14, 13b2-1 and 13b2-2 thereunder, and from aiding and abetting
Innospec's violations of Exchange Act Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and13(b)(2)
(B). Jennings will disgorge $116,092 plus prejudgment interest of $12,945,
and pay a penalty of $100,000 that takes into consideration Jennings's
cooperation in this matter.

Tracy L. Price and Denise Hansberry of the SEC Enforcement Division's FCPA
Unit conducted the investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the
U.S. Department of Justice's Fraud Section, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the U.K.'s SFO in this matter. The SEC's investigation is
continuing.

SEC Charges BNY Mellon With FCPA Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2015-170

Washington D.C., Aug. 18, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that BNY Mellon has agreed to pay $14.8
million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing valuable student internships to family members
of foreign government officials affiliated with a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.

An SEC investigation found that BNY Mellon did not evaluate or hire the family members through its existing, highly competitive internship
programs that have stringent hiring standards and require a minimum grade point average and multiple interviews. The family members did
not meet the rigorous criteria yet were hired with the knowledge and approval of senior BNY Mellon employees in order to corruptly influence
foreign officials and win or retain contracts to manage and service the assets of the sovereign wealth fund.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, the sovereign wealth fund officials requested that BNY Mellon
provide their family members with internships, and they made numerous follow-up requests about the status, timing, and other details of the
internships for their relatives. BNY Mellon employees viewed the internships as important to keep the sovereign wealth fundâs business.

âThe FCPA prohibits companies from improperly influencing foreign officials with âanything of value,â and therefore cash payments, gifts,
internships, or anything else used in corrupt attempts to win business can expose companies to an SEC enforcement action,â said Andrew J.
Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division. âBNY Mellon deserved significant sanction for providing valuable student internships to
family members of foreign officials to influence their actions.â

The SECâs order finds that BNY Mellon lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect the improper hiring practices. The company
did have an FCPA compliance policy, but maintained few specific controls around the hiring of customers and relatives of customers,
including foreign government officials. Sales staff and client relationship managers were permitted wide discretion in their initial hiring
decisions, and human resources personnel were not trained to flag potentially problematic hires. Senior managers were able to approve
hires requested by foreign officials with no mechanism for review by legal or compliance staff. BNY Mellonâs system of internal accounting
controls was insufficiently tailored to the corruption risks inherent in the hiring of client referrals, and therefore was inadequate to fully
effectuate BNY Mellonâs stated policy against bribery of foreign officials.

âFinancial services providers face unique corruption risks when seeking to win business in international markets, and we will continue to
scrutinize industries that have not been vigilant about complying with the FCPA,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement
Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

The SECâs order finds that in 2010 and 2011, BNY Mellon violated the anti-bribery and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, the company agreed to pay $8.3 million in disgorgement, $1.5 million in prejudgment
interest, and a $5 million penalty. The SEC considered the companyâs remedial acts and its cooperation with the investigation when
determining a settlement.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Eric Heining, Rory Alex, Richard Harper, and Rachel Hershfang of the Boston Regional Office. The
case was supervised by Paul G. Block of the FCPA Unit.

",2015-170,--ERROR--,SEC Charges BNY Mellon With FCPA Violations.,"Washington D.C., Aug. 18, 2015 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that BNY Mellon has agreed to pay $14.8 million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing valuable student internships to family members of foreign government officials affiliated with a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.

An SEC investigation found that BNY Mellon did not evaluate or hire the family members through its existing, highly competitive internship programs that have stringent hiring standards and require a minimum grade point average and multiple interviews.

SEC Charges Siemens AG for Engaging in Worldwide
Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2008-294

Washington, D.C., Dec. 15, 2008 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today announced an unprecedented settlement with Siemens AG to resolve
SEC charges that the Munich, Germany-based manufacturer of industrial and
consumer products violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by
engaging in a systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government
officials to obtain business.

 

Additional Materials

Â® Litigation Release No. 20829
Â®Â» SEC Complaint

 

The SEC alleges that Siemens paid bribes on such widespread transactions as
the design and construction of metro transit lines in Venezuela, power plants
in Israel, and refineries in Mexico. Siemens also used bribes to obtain such
business as developing mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh, national
identity cards in Argentina, and medical devices in Vietnam, China, and
Russia. According to the SEC's complaint, Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi
ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq
under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned more than
$1.1 billion in profits on these and several other transactions.

Siemens has agreed to pay $350 million in disgorgement to settle the SEC's
charges, and a $450 million fine to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle
criminal charges. Siemens also will pay a fine of approximately $569 million to
the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, to whom the company
previously paid an approximately $285 million fine in October 2007.

""Public companies that bribe foreign officials are confronting an increasingly
well-coordinated international law enforcement effort,"" said SEC Chairman
Christopher Cox. ""The SEC has brought a record number of enforcement
actions for foreign bribery during the past two years, and heightened
international cooperation has been critical to those successful efforts.
Seimens paid staggering amounts of money to circumvent the rules and gain
business. Now, they will pay for it with the largest settlement in the history of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act since it became law in 1977.""

Linda Chatman Thomsen, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement, said,
""This pattern of bribery by Siemens was unprecedented in scale and
geographic reach. The corruption alleged in the SEC's complaint involved
more than $1.4 billion in bribes to government officials in Asia, Africa, Europe,
the Middle East, and the Americas. Our success in bringing the company to
justice is a testament to the close, coordinated working relationship among
the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, and international law enforcement,
particularly the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich.""

Cheryl J. Scarboro, an Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement,
said, ""The day is past when multi-national corporations could regard illicit
payments to foreign officials as simply another cost of doing business. The
$1.6 billion in combined sanctions that Siemens will pay in the U.S. and
Germany should make clear that these corrupt business practices will be
rooted out wherever they take place, and the sanctions for them will be
severe.""

The SEC's complaint alleges that between March 12, 2001, and Sept. 30,
2007, Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of
its corrupt payments, and the company's inadequate internal controls allowed
the conduct to flourish. Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties
in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the
money. Employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash desks, which
were sometimes transported in suitcases across international borders for
bribery. The authorizations for payments were placed on post-it notes and
later removed to eradicate any permanent record. Siemens used numerous
slush funds, off-books accounts maintained at unconsolidated entities, and a
system of business consultants and intermediaries to facilitate the corrupt
payments. Siemens made at least 4,283 payments, totaling approximately
$1.4 billion, to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens
around the world. In addition, Siemens made approximately 1,185 separate
payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million, which were not
properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for such illicit purposes as
commercial bribery and embezzlement.
The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior
management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA.
The SEC's complaint alleges that despite the company's knowledge of bribery
at two of its largest groups â Communications and Power Generation â the
tone at the top at Siemens was inconsistent with an effective FCPA
compliance program and created a corporate culture in which bribery was
tolerated and even rewarded at the highest levels of the company. In
November 2006, Siemens' current management began to implement reforms
to the company's internal controls, which substantially reduced, but did not
entirely eliminate, corrupt payments. All but $27.5 million of the corrupt
payments occurred before Nov. 15, 2006.

Siemens violated Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act) by making illicit payments to foreign government officials in
order to obtain or retain business. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Exchange Act by failing to have adequate internal controls to detect and
prevent the payments. Siemens violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange
Act by improperly recording the payments in its books and records.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Siemens has consented to
the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from future violations of
Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act; ordering it to
pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include
profits factored into Munich's fine; and ordering it to comply with certain
undertakings regarding its FCPA compliance program, including an
independent monitor for a period of four years. Since being approached by
SEC staff, Siemens has cooperated fully with the ongoing investigation.
Siemens' massive internal investigation and lower level employee amnesty
program was essential in gathering facts regarding the full extent of Siemens'
FCPA violations.

The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud
Section; the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, Fraud and
Public Corruption Section; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Internal
Revenue Service; the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany;
the U.K. Financial Services Authority; and the Hong Kong Securities and
Futures Commission.

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement
Release No. 1688 / December 10, 2002

SEC Obtains $500,000 Penalty Against Syncor
International Corporation for Violating the Anti-Bribery
Provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Syncor International
Corporation, Case No. 1:02CV02421 (U.S.D.C., D.D.C)

On December 10, 2002, the Commission filed two settled enforcement
proceedings charging Syncor International Corporation, a radiopharmaceutical
company based in Woodland Hills, California, with violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). First, the Commission filed a lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia charging Syncor with
violating the FCPA and seeking a civil penalty. Second, the Commission issued
an administrative order finding that Syncor violated the anti-bribery, books-
and-records, and internal-controls provisions of the FCPA, ordering Syncor to
cease and desist from such violations, and requiring Syncor to retain an
independent consultant to review and make recommendations concerning the
company's FCPA compliance policies and procedures. Without admitting or
denying the Commission's charges, Syncor consented to the entry of a final
judgment in the federal lawsuit requiring it to pay a $500,000 civil penalty
and consented to the Commission's issuance of its administrative order.

In both its federal court complaint and its administrative order, the
Commission charged that, from at least the mid-1980s through at least
September 2002, Syncor's foreign subsidiaries in Taiwan, Mexico, Belgium,
Luxembourg, and France made a total of at least $600,000 in illicit payments
to doctors employed by hospitals controlled by foreign authorities. According
to the Commission, these illicit payments were made with the purpose and
effect of influencing the doctors' decisions so that Syncor could obtain or
retain business with them and the hospitals that employed them. The
Commission charged, moreover, that the payments were made with the
knowledge and approval of senior officers of the relevant Syncor subsidiaries,
and in some cases with the knowledge and approval of Syncor's founder and
chairman of the board.

According to the Commission, by making these payments through its
subsidiaries, Syncor violated the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA (Section
30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The Commission further charged
that, by improperly recording these payments - and similar payments made to
foreign persons not affiliated with government-owned facilities - Syncor
violated the books-and-records provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(A) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Finally, the Commission charged that,
by failing to devise or maintain an effective system of internal controls to
prevent or detect these violations of the FCPA, Syncor violated the internal
accounting controls provisions of the FCPA (Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

In determining to accept Syncor's settlement offer, the Commission
considered the full cooperation that Syncor provided to the Commission staff
during its investigation. The Commission also considered the fact that Syncor
- after being alerted to the relevant conduct by another company that was
conducting due diligence relating to a previously announced merger with
Syncor - promptly brought this matter to the attention of the Commission's
staff and the U.S. Department of Justice.

In a related proceeding, the United States Department of Justice filed criminal
FCPA charges against Syncor Taiwan, Inc., a subsidiary of Syncor. (U.S. v.
Syncor Taiwan, Inc. No. 02-CR-1244-ALL (C.D. Cal.)). In that proceeding,
Syncor Taiwan has agreed to plead guilty to one count of violating the anti-
bribery provisions of the FCPA and to pay a $2 million fine.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Justice in
its investigation, which is continuing.

United Technologies Charged With Violating FCPA

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

2018-188

Washington D.C., Sept. 12, 2018 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that Connecticut-based United Technologies
Corporation will pay $13.9 million to resolve charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by making illicit payments in its
elevator and aircraft engine businesses.

According to the SECâs order, United Technologies subsidiary Otis Elevator Co. made unlawful payments to Azerbaijani officials to facilitate
the sales of elevator equipment for public housing in Baku and as part of a kickback scheme to sell elevators in China. The order also found
that United Technologies, through its joint venture, made payments to a Chinese sales agent in a bid to obtain confidential information from a
Chinese official that would help the company win engine sales to a Chinese state-owned airline. The SECâs order also found that United
Technologies improperly provided trips and gifts to various foreign officials in China, Kuwait, South Korea, Pakistan, Thailand, and Indonesia
through its Pratt & Whitney division and Otis subsidiary in order to obtain business.

âU.S. companies with global operations must implement policies and procedures that prevent bribery and motivate employees to perform
ethically,â said Tracy L. Price, Deputy Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit. âIssuers with weak internal accounting controls
open the door to corruption and other financial misconduct.â

United Technologies consented to the SECâs order without admitting or denying the findings that it violated the anti-bribery, books and
records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the company agreed to pay disgorgement of
$9,067,142 plus interest of $919,392 and a penalty of $4 million.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by Ilana Z. Sultan and M. Shahriar Masud and supervised by Tracy L. Price. The SEC appreciates the
assistance of the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.

SEC Charges Two Global Tobacco Companies With
Bribery

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2010-144

Washington, D.C., Aug. 6, 2010 â The Securities and Exchange Commission
today charged two global tobacco companies with violations of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for paying more than $5 million in bribes to
government officials in Thailand and other countries to illicitly obtain tobacco
sales contracts.

 

Additional Materials

Â» SEC Complaint v. Universal Corporation
Â®Â» SEC Complaint v. Alliance One
Â® Litigation Release No. 21618

 

The SEC alleges that Richmond, Va.-based Universal Corporation Inc. and two
competitors who have since merged to form Alliance One International Inc.
engaged in a coordinated bribery scheme in Thailand. Universal paid
approximately $800,000 in bribes to officials with the government-owned
Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (TTM) in exchange for securing approximately
$11.5 million worth of tobacco sales contracts for its subsidiaries in Brazil and
Europe. The companies that became Alliance One â Dimon Inc. and Standard
Commercial Corporation â paid more than $1.2 million in bribes to TTM
officials to obtain more than $18.3 million in sales contracts.

The SEC further alleges that Dimon and Standard (now Alliance One) made
improper payments in China, Greece, Indonesia, and Kyrgyzstan while failing
to properly record the true nature of the payments in its accounting records.
Universal made improper payments in Malawi and Mozambique and failed to
properly record them in their books and records.

To settle the SEC's charges against them, Universal agreed to pay
disgorgement of more than $4.5 million and Morrisville, N.C.-based Alliance
One agreed to pay $10 million in disgorgement. Universal agreed to pay a
criminal fine of $4.4 million and Alliance One agreed to pay a criminal fine of
$9.45 million in separate criminal proceedings announced today by the U.S.
Department of Justice.

""These large tobacco merchants used secret payments to improperly win
business and curry favor with foreign government officials around the globe,""
said Christopher Conte, Associate Director in the SEC's Division of
Enforcement.

In separate complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia, the SEC alleges that Universal and Alliance One violated the anti-
bribery, books and records, and internal control provisions of the FCPA
through their misconduct, which began as early as 1996 in Kyrgyzstan. The
bribery scheme in Thailand took place between 2000 and 2004.

According to the SEC's complaint, Universal also made a series of payments
from 2004 to 2007 to government officials in Mozambique through corporate
subsidiaries in Belgium and Africa. Universal made these payments â totaling
more than $165,000 â primarily to secure an exclusive right to purchase
tobacco from regional growers and procure legislation beneficial to the
company's business. Between 2002 and 2003, Universal subsidiaries paid a
total of $850,000 to high-ranking Malawian government officials that were not
accurately recorded in Universal's books and records.

The SEC's complaint alleges that a Dimon subsidiary â Dimon International
Kyrgyzstan (DIK) â paid more than $3 million in bribes to Kyrgyzstan
government officials to purchase Kyrgyz tobacco for resale to Dimon's
customers. Most of these payments were delivered in bags filled with $100
bills to a high-ranking government official. DIK also made improper payments
to Kyrgyzstan tax officials.

Dimon also made improper payments to tax officials in Greece and Indonesia,
according to the SEC's complaint. Standard made an improper payment to a
political candidate and provided gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses to
foreign government officials in Asia, including China and Thailand. Dimon and
Standard failed to accurately record these payments in the companies' books
and records.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Universal and Alliance
One consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining each of
them from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal control
provisions of the FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition to paying disgorgement,
each company has agreed to retain an independent monitor for three years.
The proposed settlements are subject to court approval.

In the related criminal proceedings, the Justice Department filed criminal
actions against a Universal subsidiary and two Alliance One subsidiaries
charging each of them with one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and
one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Universal and
Alliance One have entered into non-prosecution agreements with the DO] to
pay the criminal penalties and retain independent monitors for a period of
three years.

The SEC charged four former Dimon employees earlier this year for their roles
in the scheme. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Amybeth Garcia-
Bokor, Paul Gumagay, Michael Hoess, Uta Von Eckartsberg, and Christine
Neal. The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the
Department of Justice's Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

",2010-144,--ERROR--,r U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC Charges Two Global Tobacco Companies With. Bribery.,"Washington, D.C., Aug. 6, 2010 — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged two global tobacco companies with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for paying more than $5 million in bribes to government officials in Thailand and other countries to illicitly obtain tobacco sales contracts.


Additional Materials
» SEC Complaint v. Universal Corporation ®» SEC Complaint v. Alliance One ® Litigation Release No. 21618

The SEC alleges that Richmond, Va.-based Universal Corporation Inc. and two competitors who have since merged to form Alliance One International Inc.
 engaged in a coordinated bribery scheme in Thailand. Universal paid approximately $800,000 in bribes to officials with the government-owned Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (TTM) in exchange for securing approximately $11.5 million worth of tobacco sales contracts for its subsidiaries in Brazil and Europe. The companies that became Alliance One — Dimon Inc. and Standard Commercial Corporation — paid more than $1.2 million in bribes to TTM officials to obtain more than $18.3 million in sales contracts.

The SEC further alleges that Dimon and Standard (now Alliance One) made improper payments in China, Greece, Indonesia, and Kyrgyzstan while failing to properly record the true nature of the payments in its accounting records.
 Universal made improper payments in Malawi and Mozambique and failed to properly record them in their books and records.

To settle the SEC's charges against them, Universal agreed to pay disgorgement of more than $4.5 million and Morrisville, N.C.-based Alliance One agreed to pay $10 million in disgorgement. Universal agreed to pay a criminal fine of $4.4 million and Alliance One agreed to pay a criminal fine of $9.45 million in separate criminal proceedings announced today by the U.S.
 Department of Justice.

""These large tobacco merchants used secret payments to improperly win business and curry favor with foreign government officials around the globe,"" said Christopher Conte, Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Enforcement.

In separate complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the SEC alleges that Universal and Alliance One violated the anti- bribery, books and records, and internal control provisions of the FCPA through their misconduct, which began as early as 1996 in Kyrgyzstan. The bribery scheme in Thailand took place between 2000 and 2004.

According to the SEC's complaint, Universal also made a series of payments from 2004 to 2007 to government officials in Mozambique through corporate subsidiaries in Belgium and Africa. Universal made these payments — totaling more than $165,000 — primarily to secure an exclusive right to purchase tobacco from regional growers and procure legislation beneficial to the company's business. Between 2002 and 2003, Universal subsidiaries paid a total of $850,000 to high-ranking Malawian government officials that were not accurately recorded in Universal's books and records.

The SEC's complaint alleges that a Dimon subsidiary — Dimon International Kyrgyzstan (DIK) — paid more than $3 million in bribes to Kyrgyzstan government officials to purchase Kyrgyz tobacco for resale to Dimon's customers. Most of these payments were delivered in bags filled with $100 bills to a high-ranking government official. DIK also made improper payments to Kyrgyzstan tax officials.

Dimon also made improper payments to tax officials in Greece and Indonesia, according to the SEC's complaint. Standard made an improper payment to a political candidate and provided gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses to foreign government officials in Asia, including China and Thailand. Dimon and Standard failed to accurately record these payments in the companies' books and records.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Universal and Alliance One consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining each of them from violating the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal control
provisions of the FCPA, codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition to paying disgorgement, each company has agreed to retain an independent monitor for three years.
 The proposed settlements are subject to court approval.

In the related criminal proceedings, the Justice Department filed criminal actions against a Universal subsidiary and two Alliance One subsidiaries charging each of them with one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Universal and Alliance One have entered into non-prosecution agreements with the DO] to pay the criminal penalties and retain independent monitors for a period of three years.

The SEC charged four former Dimon employees earlier this year for their roles in the scheme. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Amybeth Garcia- Bokor, Paul Gumagay, Michael Hoess, Uta Von Eckartsberg, and Christine Neal. The SEC acknowledges and appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice's Fraud Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Litigation Release No. 20461 / February 21, 2008

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Flowserve Corporation, Civil
Action No. 08 CV 00294 (D.D.C.) (EGS)

SEC Files Settled Books and Records and Internal Controls Charges
Against Flowserve Corporation For Improper Payments to Iraq Under
the U.N. Oil for Food Program â Company Agrees to Pay Over $6.5
Million in Civil Penalties, Disgorgement of Profits, and Prejudgment
Interest

The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act books and records and internal controls charges against
Flowserve Corporation (""Flowserve"") in the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia. Flowserve is a Texas-based manufacturer of pumps, valves,
seals, and related automation and services to the power, oil, gas, and
chemical industries. The Commission's complaint alleges that from 2001
through 2003, two of Flowserve's subsidiaries entered into a total of twenty
contracts in which $646,488 in kickback payments were made and another
$173,758 were authorized in connection with sales of industrial equipment to
Iraqi government entities under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the
""Program'""). The kickbacks were characterized as ""after-sales service fees""
(""ASSFs""), but no bona fide services were performed. The Program was
intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced
severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the
Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow
account. The kickbacks paid by Flowserve's subsidiaries diverted funds out of
the escrow account and into an Iraqi slush fund. The contracts submitted to
the U.N. did not disclose that the illicit payments were included in the inflated
contract prices.

According to the Commission's Complaint:

A French Flowserve subsidiary, Flowserve Pompes, entered into fifteen
Program contracts involving kickback payments of $604,651. Flowserve
Pompes agreed to, but did not ultimately make, an additional $173,758 in
improper ASSF payments under four additional contracts. Delivery under
these four contracts had not been completed by the time of the U.S. invasion
of Iraq in March 2003. Senior officials at Flowserve Pompes, including the
subsidiary's President, developed two different false cover stories to conceal
the ASSF kickback payments. The company's internal accounting records
falsely indicated that Flowserve Pompes paid a Jordanian agent a ten percent
fee on each contract to cover the cost of installing and commissioning the
equipment. In reality, the agent provided no such services. The contract
documents that Flowserve Pompes sent to the U.N. for approval painted a
different, but equally false, picture. These documents omitted any reference
to after sales services or related installation fees. Instead, to cover the cost of
the illicit ASSF payments, the company's U.N. contracts inflated the unit price
of each piece of equipment without disclosing the price increases, or the
reason for them, to the U.N. Flowserve Pompes also signed a side letter to the
Iraqi ministry to pay the ten percent, and failed to disclose the letter to the
U.N. Knowing that the kickback payments had to be received before the
goods would be allowed across the border, Flowserve Pompes paid its agent
immediately. The agent then made the kickback payment by depositing cash
into an Iraqi-controlled account in Jordan.

Flowserve's Dutch subsidiary, Flowserve B.V., entered into one contract
involving an ASSF kickback payment of $41,836. The contract was for the
supply of water pump Spare parts to the Iraqi government-owned South Gas
Company. In August 2001, officials of Flowserve B.V. met with the company's
agent and were advised that the agent would have to pay a ten percent
kickback on the transaction on Flowserve B.V.'s behalf, for which the agent
would need reimbursement. Flowserve B.V.'s controller chose to conceal the
payment by increasing the cost of the purchase order by ten percent and
passing the difference back to the agent. In September 2001, Flowserve B.V.
agreed to pay a supplemental commission â euphemistically labeled a
""special project discount"" â to the agent to cover the amount of the kickback.
Upon receiving its supplemental commission payment, the agent paid the ten
percent kickback to the South Gas Company on Flowserve B.V.'s behalf.

Flowserve either knew or was reckless in not knowing that illicit payments
were either offered or paid in connection with these transactions. Flowserve
failed to maintain an adequate system of internal controls to detect and
prevent the payments. Flowserve's accounting for these transactions failed
properly to record the nature of the company's payments. The company's
books falsely characterized the ASSF payments either as payments for
services actually performed or as agent commissions.

Flowserve, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's
complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it
from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $2,720,861, in profits, plus
$853,364 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000,000.
Flowserve will also pay a $4,000,000 fine pursuant to a deferred prosecution
agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section. Flowserve B.V.
will enter into a criminal disposition with the Dutch Public Prosecutor pursuant
to which it will pay a fine.

The Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Flowserve
and the cooperation the company afforded the Commission staff in its
investigation. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the
Department of Justice, Fraud Section and the United Nations Independent
Inquiry Committee.

(D.D.C.) (filed March 18, 2011)

IBM TO PAY $10 MILLION IN SETTLED FCPA ENFORCEMENT ACTION

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today charged International
Business Machines Corporation (âIBMâ) with violating the books and records
and internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977
(âFCPAâ) as a result of the provision of improper cash payments, gifts, and
travel and entertainment to government officials in South Korea and China.

As alleged in the SECâs Complaint, from 1998 to 2003, employees of IBM
Korea, Inc., an IBM subsidiary, and LG IBM PC Co., Ltd., a joint venture in
which IBM held a majority interest, paid cash bribes and provided improper
gifts and payments of travel and entertainment expenses to various
government officials in South Korea in order to secure the sale of IBM
products.

It was further alleged that, from at least 2004 to early 2009, employees of
IBM (China) Investment Company Limited and IBM Global Services (China)
Co., Ltd., both wholly-owned IBM subsidiaries, engaged in a widespread
practice of providing overseas trips, entertainment, and improper gifts to
Chinese government officials.

Without admitting or denying the SECâs allegations, IBM consented to the
entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from
violating the books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA,
codified as Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. IBM also agreed to pay disgorgement of $5,300,000, $2,700,000
in prejudgment interest, and a $2,000,000 civil penalty.

Litigation Release No. 21335 / December 14, 2009

SEC v. Bobby Benton, Civil Action No. 4:09-CV-03963 (S.D. Texas,
December 11, 2009).

SEC CHARGES FORMER OFFICER OF PRIDE INTERNATIONAL WITH
VIOLATING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT

On December 11, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a
former officer of Pride International, Inc. (Pride) with violations relating to
bribes paid to foreign officials in Mexico and Venezuela. The Commission's
complaint names Bobby Benton of Houston, Texas, Pride's former Vice
President, Western Hemisphere Operations.

The complaint alleges that in December 2004, Benton authorized the bribery
of a Mexican customs official in return for favorable treatment regarding
customs deficiencies identified during an inspection of a supply boat. The
complaint further alleges that Benton had knowledge of a second bribe paid
to a different Mexican customs official that same month. It is also alleged that
from approximately 2003 to 2005, a manager of a Pride subsidiary in
Venezuela authorized the bribery of an official of Venezuela's state-owned oil
company in order to secure extensions of three drilling contracts. Benton, in
an effort to conceal these payments, redacted references to bribery in an
action plan responding to an internal audit report and signed two false
certifications in connection with audits and reviews of Pride's financial
statements denying any knowledge of bribery.

The SEC's complaint charges Benton with violating Sections 13(b)(5) and 30A
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 13b2-1 and 13b2-2
thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A), 13(b)
(2)(B), and 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC's action
seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and the disgorgement of ill-
gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.

The Commission acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the
Department of Justice and the FBI.

The SEC's investigation continues.

SEC Charges Oregon-Based Defense Contractor With FCPA
Violations

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2015-62

Washington D.C., April 8, 2015 â The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Oregon-based FLIR Systems Inc. with violating the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by financing what an employee termed a âworld tourâ of personal travel for government officials in the
Middle East who played key roles in decisions to purchase FLIR products. FLIR earned more than $7 million in profits from sales influenced by
the improper travel and gifts.

FLIR, which develops infrared technology for use in binoculars and other sensing products and systems, agreed to settle the SECâs charges by
paying more than $9.5 million and reporting its FCPA compliance efforts to the agency for the next two years. The SEC previously charged
two FLIR employees in the case.

âFLIRâs deficient financial controls failed to identify and stop the activities of employees who served as de facto travel agents for influential
foreign officials to travel around the world on the companyâs dime,â said Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Divisionâs FCPA Unit.

According to the SECâs order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against FLIR, the company had few internal controls over gifts
and travel out of its foreign sales offices. Two employees in its Dubai office provided expensive watches to government officials with the
Saudi Arabia Ministry of Interior in 2009, and they arranged for the company to pay for a 20-night excursion by Saudi officials that included
stops in Casablanca, Paris, Dubai, Beirut, and New York City. The value of the gifts and the extent and nature of the travel were falsely
recorded in FLIRâs books and records as legitimate business expenses, and the companyâs internal controls failed to catch the improper
payments despite documentation suggesting that extravagant gifts and travel were being provided.

The SECâs order finds that from 2008 to 2010, FLIR paid approximately $40,000 for additional travel by Saudi government officials, including
multiple New Yearâs Eve trips to Dubai with airfare, hotel, and expensive dinners and drinks. FLIR also accepted cursory invoices from a FLIR
company partner without any supporting documentation to pay extended travel of Egyptian officials in mid-2011.

The SECâs order finds that FLIR violated the anti-bribery provisions of Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the internal
controls and books-and-records provisions of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. FLIR self-reported the misconduct to
the SEC and cooperated with the SECâs investigation. FLIR consented to the order without admitting or denying the findings and agreed to
pay disgorgement of $7,534,000, prejudgment interest of $970,584 and a penalty of $1 million for a total of $9,504,584.

The SECâs investigation was conducted by FCPA Unit members Cameron P. Hoffman and Tracy L. Davis in the San Francisco office. The SEC
appreciates the assistance of the Justice Departmentâs Fraud Section, the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of Massachusetts, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, and the United Arab Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-AND-
In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS AND-DESIST ORDER PURSUANT TO
CORPORATION, SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Respondent.
I.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionââ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Diagnostic Products Corporation (âDPCâ or
Respondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferââ) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-
and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
IIl.
On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

1. DPC, a California corporation based in Los Angeles, develops and manufactures
medical diagnostic test systems and related test kits. DPC sells its products through subsidiaries
and distributors in over 100 countries, and overseas sales have accounted for over 70% of its
annual revenues. DPCâs common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section
12(b) of the Exchange Act and are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

2. In October 1991, DPC established DePu Biotechnological & Medical Products
Inc. (âDePuââ) in Tianjin, China as a joint venture. Initially, DPC owned 90% of DePu and the
joint venture partner was a local Chinese government entity. In 1997, DePu became a wholly-
owned subsidiary of DPC. Throughout the relevant period, the financial results of DePu were a
component of the consolidated financial statements included in DPC's filings with the
Commission.

3. As discussed below in Paragraph 6, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (âFCPAââ)
prohibits public companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of
influencing their decisions in order to obtain or retain business. DePuâs customers are primarily
state-owned hospitals in China. From 1991 through 2002, DPC through DePu routinely made
improper commission payments totaling approximately $1.6 million to doctors and laboratory
employees who controlled purchasing decisions at these state-owned hospitals. The commissions
represented a certain percentage of sales to the hospitals (typically 3% to 10%), and DePu
determined the percentages based on the prevailing rate in the customerâs region, the sales amount,
and the prior relationship with the customer. In most cases the payments were made in cash and
delivered by DePuâs sales employees by mail or wire transfer. During the relevant period, DePuâs
then management knew about, approved, and administered the payment of these commissions.

4. From 1991 through 2002, DePu improperly recorded the payments as legitimate
sales expenses in its books and records.

5. In late October 2002, DePuâs auditors raised certain Chinese tax issues related to
the commission payments. In November 2002, DePuâs then senior manager discussed the
payments and the tax issues in a monthly report to current DPC management, which led to
DPCâs discovery of these payments. In January 2003, DPC instructed DePu management to stop
all commission payments. DPC also took remedial measures, revised its code of ethics and
compliance procedures, and established a compliance program with respect to the FCPA.

6. The FCPA, enacted in 1977, added Section 30A to the Exchange Act to prohibit
public companies from, among other things, making improper payments to foreign officials for the

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and
are not binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
purpose of influencing their decisions in order to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also added
to the Exchange Act Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), which require public companies to keep
accurate books and records and have sufficient internal controls. Public companies are responsible
for ensuring that their foreign subsidiaries comply with Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and (B), and 30A of
the Exchange Act.

7. Throughout the relevant period, the individuals who received improper payments
from DePu were foreign officials within the meaning of the FCPA, and the hospitals were
instrumentalities of a foreign government within the meaning of the FCPA. The purpose of the
improper payments was to influence these individualsâ official decisions and to induce them to use
their influence with the hospitals to assist DPC to obtain or retain business.

8. As a result of the conduct described above with respect to the payments of improper
commissions to individuals, DPC violated Section 30A of the Exchange Act, which prohibits
making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of influencing their decisions in
order to obtain or retain business.

9. As a result of the conduct described above with respect to the booking of the
improper payments as legitimate sales expenses, DPC violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) of the
Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books, records, and accounts
which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and dispositions of their
assets.

10. In addition, as evidenced by the duration of the improper payments made by DePu
and the improper recording of such payments in DePuâs books and records, DPC violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (1)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorization; and
(11) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such
statements, and to maintain accountability for assets.

DPCâs Remedial Efforts

In determining to accept the Offer, the Commission considered remedial acts
promptly undertaken by Respondent and cooperation afforded the Commission staff. 7

Undertakings

Respondent has undertaken the following:

 

* The Commission also has taken into consideration that DPC will pay a criminal penalty
in the amount of $2 million in the Department of Justice prosecution for the same conduct
described in this Order.
1. Within 30 days after the date of this Order, DPC shall retain a qualified
independent compliance consultant (the ""Compliance Consultant""), not unacceptable to the staff
of the Commission, to review annually DPC's compliance with its FCPA policies and procedures
for a period of three years from the date of engagement. DPC shall cause the Compliance
Consultant to complete its review and submit a report annually on the anniversary date of its
engagement, in which it shall document its findings and, if necessary, make recommendations
(the ""Report"") to DPCâs Board of Directors, a copy of which shall be transmitted
contemporaneously to the staff of the Commission. In the event a Report contains any
recommendation for further action by DPC, within 90 days after receiving the Report, DPC's
Board of Directors shall advise the staff of the Commission, in writing, of all decisions and
determinations it has made as a result of the Report.

2. In the event DPC is acquired by another company and becomes a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the acquiring company before it has fully complied with all of the terms of the
above paragraph 1, DPC's obligations under paragraph | shall remain in effect only as to DPC as
a wholly-owned subsidiary and only as to DPC's Board of Directors as constituted following the
acquisition. In the event DPC is acquired by another company and ceases to be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of such acquiring company before DPC has fully complied with all of the terms of this
paragraph, DPC's obligations under paragraph 1 shall terminate upon the Compliance
Consultantâs submission of a report acceptable to the staff of the Commission certifying that (4) it
has reviewed the FCPA compliance program of the acquiring company; (11) such program is
adequate; and (411) DPCâs operations are adequately integrated into such compliance program,
otherwise, the acquiring company shall assume DPCâs obligations under paragraph 1.

3. DPC (i) shall not have the authority to terminate the Compliance Consultant
without the prior written approval of the majority of DPCâs independent board members and the
