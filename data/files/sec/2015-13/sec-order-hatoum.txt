In the Matter of DESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
Walid Hatoum EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASE-
Respondent. AND-DESIST ORDER
I,

The Securities and Exchange Commission (âCommissionâ) deems it appropriate that cease-
and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ), against Walid Hatoum (âHatoumâ or âRespondentâ).

Il.

In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the âOfferâ), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commissionâs jurisdiction over him and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, and except as provided herein in Section V, Respondent
consents to the entry of this Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to
Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-
and-Desist Order (âOrderâ), as set forth below.
Hil.

On the basis of this Order and Respondentâs Offer, the Commission findsâ that:

Summary

1. These proceedings arise from violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 (the âFCPAâ) [15 U.S.C. 78dd] by Respondent Walid Hatoum concerning offers of
payment and other benefits to foreign officials in Qatar in connection with the award of
government contracts to PBS&J International, Inc. (âPBSJ&J Intâlâ), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of PBSJ Corporation (âPBSJâ).

Respondent

2. Walid Hatoum (âHatoumâ), age 55, is a United States citizen who initially
worked for PBSJ as an engineer from 1986 until 1990. In February 2009, Hatoum was rehired to
join PBS&J Intâl as its Director of International Marketing, even though his prior employment
file at PBSJ had been marked âIneligible for Rehire.â Although Hatoum did not formally join
PBS&J Intâ! until April 2009, he assisted PBS&/J Intâ! with identifying projects as early as
November 2008. Hatoum was promoted to President of PBS&J Intâ] in mid-June 2009, and
became an officer of PBSJ at the same time.

 

Relevant Entities

3. The PBSJ Corporation (âPBSJâ) was an employee-owned engineering and
construction firm incorporated in Florida and headquartered in Tampa. Through the relevant
period, PBSJâs common stock was registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (âExchange Actâ) and PBSJ filed annual and quarterly reports as required
under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules thereunder.â

4. PBS&J International, Inc. (ââPBS&J Int'lâ) was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PBSJ headquartered and incorporated in Florida. PBS&/J Intâ] was a provider of engineering,

 

' The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent's Offer of Settlement and are not

binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.

On October 1, 2010, after the conduct at issue, WS Atkins ple (âAtkinsâ), a public limited engineering and

design company based in the United Kingdom and organized under the laws of England and Wales, acquired PBSJ
and all of its common stock. Atkins is traded on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol ATK.L. That day,
PBSJ filed a Form 15 with the Commission, which terminated all offerings of its securities and removed all
remaining securities from registration under Section 12(g). Post-acquisition, PBSJ became an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of Atkins. On April 1, 2011, PBSJ changed its name to The Atkins North America Holdings
Corporation.

architectural and planning services in international markets, including the Middle East. PBS&J
Intâ! currently is a subsidiary of Atkins.

Facts

5. During 2009, PBS&J Intâ! won two multi-million dollar development contracts.
One contract was for work in Qatar and the other was for work in Morocco. Both were
competitively solicited and approved by the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company
(âQatari Diarâ). Qatari Diar was established by the Qatari government to coordinate the
countryâs real estate development.

6. PBSJ and PBS&J Intâ1, through Hatoum, offered bribes to the then-Director of
International Projects at Qatari Diar (âForeign Officialâ), to secure Qatari government contracts
by planning to funnel funds to a local company the Foreign Official owned and controlled
(âLocal Partnerâ). Foreign Official, a former business colleague of Hatoumâs at another U.S.
engineering firm, worked for Qatari Diar throughout 2009, until his resignation from Qatari Diar
on December 21, 2009. Prior to joining PBSJ, Hatoum and Foreign Official discussed directing
business in the Middle East to Local Partner.

7. In return, Foreign Official provided PBS&J Intâ! with access to confidential
sealed-bid information and pricing information on the two government contracts that helped
PBS&J Intâ! tender bids that had a greater likelihood of being awarded, including a government
contract for which the Foreign Official was the project manager.

Offers and Promises Made to Foreign Official

LRT Project in Qatar

 

8. In November and December 2008, Hatoum began discussing potential
employment with PBSJ. Even before he received a formal employment contract, Hatoum met
with PBS&J Intâ] to discuss opportunities to grow PBS&J Intâ] business in the Middle East.
Hatoum discussed projects involving Qatari Diar, including a light rail transit project in Qatar
(âthe LRT Projectâ).

9. In January 2009, Hatoum arranged for Foreign Officialâs brother, through Local
Partner, to introduce PBS&J Intâ] to Qatari Diar senior executives involved in the LRT Project.
Soon after that meeting, PBS&J Intâ! decided to bid on the LRT Project. PBS&J Intâ! added
Foreign Officialâs company, Local Partner, on its proposal team as a subcontractor to handle
local operations such as hiring local labor, as well as complying with bonding and insurance
requirements. In return, Hatoum and PBS&J Intâ! agreed to pay the Foreign Official, through
Local Partner, 40% of profits realized from any LRT Project contract as well as reimburse its
direct costs. The remaining profits were to be split between PBS&/J Intâ! (40%) and another
U.S.-based subcontractor (20%), which would perform all of the planning and engineering
services for the LRT project.
10. Atthat time, Hatoum was the only person at PBS&J Intâ] who had any knowledge
about Foreign Officialâs ownership interest in Local Partner. Had PBSJ conducted meaningful
due diligence at that time, it would have discovered the Foreign Officialâs dual role as both
government official and third-party owner/operator of Local Partner.

11. During the bidding process, Foreign Official gave confidential sealed bid
information to PBS&/J Intâ! to assist it in winning the LRT Project in return for promised
payments. Foreign Official also made strategic and technical decisions on many aspects of the
LRT Project that favored PBS&/J Intâ] with Hatoumâs knowledge.

12. Foreign Official used a Local Partner alias to communicate that information to
Hatoum and other PBSJ and PBS&J Intâ! employees while disguising his involvement on
multiple conference calls and in dozens of emails to the United States. Hatoum was aware that
Foreign Official was using the alias in communications with PBSJ employees, officers, and
directors and with Qatari Diar. Hatoum flew to the Middle East to meet with Qatari Diar
officials, including Foreign Official, to discuss PBS&J Intâlâs qualifications for the LRT Project.
At the meeting, neither Foreign Official nor Hatoum informed Qatari Diar that Foreign Official
was working for Local Partner and providing confidential information and other assistance to
help PBS&J Intâ] win the contracts.

13. Following its initial submission, PBS&/J Intâ] revised its bid, based on information
and guidance provided by the Foreign Official, to best position itself to win the LRT Project and
to withstand possible challenges from competitors. On or about August 3, 2009, Qatar Diar
awarded the LRT Project contract worth approximately $35.6 million to PBS&J Intâl.

14. ~â After the award, PBS&/J Intâ! opened a joint account with Local Partner that was
accessible to Foreign Officialâs wife. PBS&J Intâ] also authorized a four-year letter of credit
relating to a bank guarantee in Qatar. The letter of credit was a precondition for receipt of the
first contract payment by Qatari Diar to PBS&/J Intâl, an upfront, 10% (approximately $3.6
million) payment, which was deposited into the joint account.

15. | Once the award was received, Hatoum offered Foreign Official an âagency feeâ to
Local Partner for 1.8% of the LRT Project contract amount (equivalent to approximately
$640,000). Additionally, PBS&J Intâl agreed to pay half of the salary of Foreign Officialâs wife,
who worked for Local Partner.

Design Contract in Morocco

 

16. In addition to the LRT Project, Qatari Diar opened a Morocco hotel resort
development (âMorocco Projectâ) for competitive bid. On August 7, 2009, PBS&J Intâ! emailed
its Statement of Qualifications for the design contract to Foreign Official, the Qatari Diar project
manager for the Morocco Project.

17. In October 2009, Hatoum offered payment to Foreign Official in the form of an
agency fee to Local Partner to secure the Morocco Project. The Morocco Project was worth

4
approximately $25 million to PBSJ Intâl, of which the Foreign Official was offered an agency fee
of 3% of the contract amount, which equates to approximately $750,000. Hatoum instructed a
PBS&J Intâl employee to hide the agency fee within the companyâs bid proposal by inflating
other components of the offer for the Morocco Project.

18. Foreign Official attended meetings with PBS&/J Intâ! employees to discuss the
project but neither Foreign Official nor Hatoum told employees that he was working for Local
Partner. At the same time, Foreign Official, using his Local Partner alias, reviewed and made
changes to PBS&J Intâlâs original bid offer via email and phone. He also made key technical and
strategic proposal decisions throughout the bidding process and instructed PBS&J Intâ] to lower
its offer to a specific dollar amount. By doing so, he ensured PBS&J Intâlâs final bid had a
greater likelihood of being approved by Qatari Diar. On or around October 19, 2009, Qatari Diar
informed PBS&J Intâ! that it was awarded the Morocco Project.

Red Flags

19. PBSJ and PBS&J Intâ! officers and employees ignored multiple red flags that
should have led them to uncover the payment scheme. For example, PBS&J Intâ] and PBSJ
employees knew that Local Partner was providing them with confidential sealed bid information.
Hatoum also informed the employees that he was obtaining information from someone that
Hatoum described as a âgood friendâ and âtop executiveâ at Qatari Diar. Before PBS&J Intâ!
submitted its bid for the Morocco Project, a PBS&J Intâ! officer learned that the husband of one
of the Local Partner employees was a government official working on the Morocco Project. The
PBS&J Intâ! officer learned of Foreign Officialâs role while attending dinner with Hatoum,
Foreign Official and the Foreign Officialâs wife. In addition, a PBSJ employee knew that
âagency feesâ to Local Partner were disguised as legitimate costs within the Morocco Project
bid.

Discovery of the Payment Scheme

 

20. Shortly after PBS&J Intâl was awarded the Morocco Project contract, PBSJâs
former Chief Operating Officer commented to PBSJâs then-general counsel that PBS&J Intâ! was
successful in winning two contracts in the Middle East within a fairly short period of time.
PBSJâs then-general counsel asked Hatoum how he was able to win the LRT and Morocco
Project contracts over companies with far more international experience. Hatoum told PBSJâs
then-general counsel PBSJ offered âagency feesâ in order to win the projects and, when asked,
admitted there âwould be a problemâ if the agency fees were not paid. PBSJâs then-general
counsel immediately launched an investigation of this issue.

21. Three weeks later, in November 2009, a Qatari government official informed
Hatoum and the then-President of PBSJ that Qatari Diar had discovered Foreign Officialâs
involvement in Local Partner and was rescinding PBS&J Intâlâs contract for the Morocco
Project. Hatoum then secretly made an offer of employment to a second Qatari foreign official
in return for influencing Qatari Diar to reinstate the contract. However, Qatari Diar refused to

5
reinstate the contract and did not provide PBS&J Intâ! any proceeds for the project. PBSJ
suspended Hatoum in December 2009. Hatoum also began deleting emails and other records.

22. PBS&J Intl and Qatari Diar negotiated a termination of the LRT Project contract
effective December 31, 2009. In January 2010, Qatari Diar entered into a bridge contract with
PBS&J Intâl to continue work on the LRT Project (the âBridge Contractâ) until a replacement
company could be found. Ultimately, the period of performance on the Bridge Contract was 16
Â¥% months. PBS&J Intâ] earned $2,892,504 in profits on the Bridge Contract. PBSJ and Qatari
Diar caught Hatoumâs scheme before any of the offered and authorized amounts were paid.

Hatoum Caused PBSJâs Inaccurate Books and Records

23. Hatoum authorized illicit payments to Foreign Official that were not accurately
and fairly reflected on PBSJâs books and records. Hatoum directed subordinates to conceal some
of the payments he offered and authorized to Foreign Official within bids. Other offers and
promises to pay authorized by Hatoum to Foreign Official were improperly described in the
books and records as legitimate transaction costs with his knowledge.

Hatoum Caused PBSJâs Internal Accounting Control Failure

24. On April 22, 2009, Hatoum signed a âBusiness Conduct Standardsâ agreement for
PBSJ employees in which he agreed that âI will neither accept nor give bribes or kickbacks of
any value for services or favorable treatment for contracts.â As a high level manager at PBS&J
Intâ! and later as an officer of PBSJ, Hatoum was responsible for maintaining and ensuring
compliance with PBSJâs internal accounting controls at PBS&J Intâ]. Hatoum, however,
repeatedly exploited the companyâs internal accounting control deficiencies to offer and
authorize payments to Foreign Official through Local Partner totaling approximately $1,390,000
to secure the LRT and Morocco Projects, plus 40% of any profits realized from the LRT Project
and partial salary to Foreign Officialâs wife. Hatoum instructed subordinates to inflate PBS&J
Intâ! bids by concealing payments to Local Partner intended for Foreign Official. Hatoum took
advantage of PBSJâs accounting controls system by introducing Local Partner as a âlegitimateâ
potential partner for the LRT Project and authorized a subordinate to execute an agreement to
pay Local Partner 40% of the LRT Project profits without subjecting Local Partner or its
employees to any meaningful due diligence. Hatoum also knowingly executed - and caused a
PBS&J Intâl employee to send a questionnaire requesting advocacy assistance from the United
States Department of Commerce that included false representations about Local Partner and
PBS&J Intl. Although Hatoum did not participate in PBSJâs FCPA training until after the
scheme was uncovered, Hatoum was aware of the prohibitions of the FCPA from annual FCPA
training that he received from his former employer.
