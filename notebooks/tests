## Tests
---------------------------------------------------------
<br>

Testing is set up using [pytest](http://pytest.org) and coverage is handled
with the pytest-cov plugin.

Run your tests with ```pytest``` in the root directory.

Coverage is ran by default and is set in the ```pytest.ini``` file.
To see an html output of coverage open ```htmlcov/index.html``` after running the tests.
