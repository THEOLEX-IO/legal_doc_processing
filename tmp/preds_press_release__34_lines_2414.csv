NPAs are part of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cooperation Initiative, which rewards cooperation in SEC investigations.
That level of self-policing along with its self-reporting and cooperation led to this resolution.""
Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation saved the agency substantial time and resources ordinarily consumed in investigations of comparable conduct.

The SEC took into account the significant remedial measures undertaken by Ralph Lauren Corporation, including a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations.
The misconduct came to light as a result of the company adopting measures to improve its worldwide internal controls and compliance efforts, including implementation of an FCPA compliance training program in Argentina.
According to the NPA, the bribes occurred during a period when Ralph Lauren Corporation lacked meaningful anti-corruption compliance and control mechanisms over its Argentine subsidiary.
Among Ralph Lauren Corporation's remedial measures have been new compliance training, termination of employment and business arrangements with all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, and strengthening its internal controls and its procedures for third party due diligence.
Ralph Lauren Corporation also conducted a risk assessment of its major operations worldwide to identify any other compliance problems.
Ralph Lauren Corporation discovered this problem after it put in place an enhanced compliance program and began training its employees."
