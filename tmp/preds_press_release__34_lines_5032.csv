The SEC has determined not to charge Ralph Lauren Corporation with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) due to the company's prompt reporting of the violations on its own initiative, the completeness of the information it provided, and its extensive, thorough, and real-time cooperation with the SEC's investigation.
NPAs are part of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cooperation Initiative, which rewards cooperation in SEC investigations.
""The NPA in this matter makes clear that we will confer substantial and tangible benefits on companies that respond appropriately to violations and cooperate fully with the SEC.""
That level of self-policing along with its self-reporting and cooperation led to this resolution.""
According to the NPA, Ralph Lauren Corporation's cooperation included: e",,USD,2013-04-22,,"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Ralph Lauren Corporation discovered this problem after it put in place an enhanced compliance program and began training its employees.
Kara Brockmeyer, the SEC's FCPA Unit Chief, added, ""This NPA shows the benefit of implementing an effective compliance program.
According to the NPA, the bribes occurred during a period when Ralph Lauren Corporation lacked meaningful anti-corruption compliance and control mechanisms over its Argentine subsidiary.
The SEC took into account the significant remedial measures undertaken by Ralph Lauren Corporation, including a comprehensive new compliance program throughout its operations.
The misconduct came to light as a result of the company adopting measures to improve its worldwide internal controls and compliance efforts, including implementation of an FCPA compliance training program in Argentina.
Among Ralph Lauren Corporation's remedial measures have been new compliance training, termination of employment and business arrangements with all individuals involved in the wrongdoing, and strengthening its internal controls and its procedures for third party due diligence."
