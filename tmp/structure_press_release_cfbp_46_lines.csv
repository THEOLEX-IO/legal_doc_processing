Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Mortgage Companies to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

JUL 24, 2020

Washington, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued
consent orders against Sovereign Lending Group, Inc. (Sovereign) and Prime Choice
Funding, Inc. (Prime Choice). Sovereign is a California corporation that is licensed as a
mortgage broker or lender in about 44 states and the District of Columbia. Prime Choice is
a California corporation that is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 35 states
and the District of Columbia. Both companies offer and provide mortgage loans
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Their principal means
of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to
United States military servicemembers and veterans. The Bureau found that the companies
mailed consumers advertisements for VA-guaranteed mortgages that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or lacked required disclosures, in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and
practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices - Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z.
The consent orders require the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose
requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs actions stem from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple mortgage
companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages. The Bureau
commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful advertising in
the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising provides
consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and terms
available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This ongoing
sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure
the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Sovereign and Prime disseminated advertisements that contained
false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures.
For example, Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements misrepresented the credit terms
of the advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually
prepared to offer to the consumer. Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements
misleadingly described an advertised introductory interest rate as a âfixedâ rate, when in fact
the rate was adjustable and could increase over time. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also created the false impression that they were affiliated with the
government by using words, phrases, images, or designs that are associated with the VA or
the Internal Revenue Service.

The Bureau also found that both Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements used the
name of the consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing their own
names and the fact that they were not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the
consumer's current lender, as required by Regulation Z. Sovereign advertisements made
false claims about consumer's existing loans, and falsely implied that the consumer could
address these problems by obtaining a loan from Sovereign. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit terms
for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan and the period during which certain interest rates would apply. Further,
Prime Choice advertisements created the false impression that they contained a property
assessment as well as misleading comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the
terms of the advertised product.

The consent order against Sovereign requires Sovereign to pay a civil penalty of $460,000.
The consent order against Prime Choice requires Prime Choice to pay a civil penalty of
$645,000. The consent orders also impose injunctive relief to prevent future violations,
including requiring the companies to bolster their compliance functions by designating an
advertising compliance official who must review their mortgage advertisements for
compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting
misrepresentations similar to those identified by the Bureau; and requiring the companies
to comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent them from making
future misrepresentations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Multiple States Enter into Settlement
with Nationstar Mortgage, LLC for Unlawful Servicing Practices

DEC 07, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
complaint and proposed stipulated judgment and order against Nationstar Mortgage, LLC,
which does business as Mr. Cooper (Nationstar). The Bureauâs action is part of a
coordinated effort between the Bureau, a multistate group of state attorneys general, and
state bank regulators. The Bureau alleges that Nationstar violated multiple Federal
consumer financial laws, causing substantial harm to the borrowers whose mortgage loans it
serviced, including distressed homeowners. Nationstar is one of the nationâs largest
mortgage servicers and the largest non-bank mortgage servicer in the United States. The
proposed judgment and order, if entered by the court, would require Nationstar to pay
approximately $73 million in redress to more than 40,000 harmed borrowers. It would also
require Nationstar to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty to the Bureau. Attorneys general from
all 50 states and the District of Columbia and bank regulators from 53 jurisdictions covering
48 states and Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia have also settled
with Nationstar today and their settlements are reflected in separate actions, concurrently
filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

âMortgage servicers are entrusted with handling significant financial transactions for millions
of Americans, including struggling homeowners. Nationstar broke that trust by engaging in
unfair and deceptive practices prohibited by the Consumer Financial Protection Act of

2010, as well as violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the
Homeowner's Protection Act,â said CFPB Director Kathleen L. Kraninger. âToday's action is
the culmination of a multi-year effort working with our state partners to investigate
Nationstarâs failings, which resulted in substantial consumer harm. We had a strong
partnership with our state counterparts in this case and | thank them for all their support in
this case.â

âThis settlement demonstrates the crucial role of state financial services regulators in
ensuring that homeowners are protected as they obtain and pay down their mortgagesâ
especially homeowners who may be struggling with making their payments,â said Illinois
Department of Financial and Professional Regulation Secretary Deborah Hagan. âThis
resolution demonstrates that a commitment to government coordination provides a path to
efficient, effective, and comprehensive outcomes for both consumers and for Mr. Cooper,
who will be held to the highest operational standards as it continues to provide mortgage
services across the nation.â

The Bureauâs and Statesâ proposed judgments and orders, if entered by the court, will yield
nearly $85 million in recoveries for consumers to date and over $6 million more in fees and
penalties. They are also part of a larger government effort, which also includes assistance
from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) and
the United States Trustee Program, to address Nationstarâs alleged unlawful mortgage loan
servicing practices.

In its complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, the Bureau alleges
that Nationstar engaged in unfair and deceptive acts and practices in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, violated the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act (RESPA), and violated the Homeowner's Protection Act of 1998 (HPA). Specifically, the
Bureau alleges that between January 2012 and January 1, 2016, in numerous instances
Nationstar failed to identify loans on its systems that had pending loss-mitigation
applications or trial-modification plans, and as a result failed to honor borrowersâ loan
modification agreements. Nationstar allegedly foreclosed on borrowers to whom it had
promised it would not foreclose while their loss mitigation applications were pending.
Nationstar also allegedly improperly increased borrowersâ permanent, modified monthly
loan payments, mispresented to borrowers when they would be eligible to have their
private mortgage insurance premiums canceled, and failed to timely remove private
mortgage insurance from borrowersâ accounts. Nationstar allegedly failed to timely disburse
borrowersâ tax payments from their escrow accounts and failed to properly conduct escrow
analyses for borrowers during their Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.

If entered by the court, Nationstar would be required to immediately set aside about $15.6
million to pay borrowers it has not remediated prior to the order's effective date and to
certify that it has already paid approximately $57.5 million in redress to other borrowers
affected by the conduct alleged in the complaint. The stipulated judgment and order would
also require Nationstar, among other things, to enhance its policies and processes including
with respect to handling consumer complaints and disputes, conducting escrow analyses
on borrowersâ accounts, transferring information during servicing transfers, offering loss
mitigation, and terminating borrowersâ private mortgage insurance.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Ninth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

OCT 26, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. -â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Low VA Rates LLC (Low VA Rates) to address the Bureauâs finding that
Low VA Rates sent consumers mailers for mortgage loans guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate
statements. Low VA Ratesâ conduct violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices -
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. Low VA Rates, a Utah-based mortgage
lender and broker incorporated in Colorado and licensed in 48 states and DC, advertised
their VA-guaranteed loans through direct-mail primarily to U.S. military servicemembers and
veterans. The consent order requires Low VA Rates to pay a civil money penalty of
$1,800,000 to the Bureau and imposes requirements to prevent future violations. Today's
action is the ninth and last case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that used deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.
The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns raised by the VA about
potentially unlawful advertising in the mortgage lending market. The Bureau's response and
investigations reflect its commitment to enforcing the laws to ensure the financial
marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers, veterans, and
surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit. The Bureau
has obtained more than $4.4 million in civil money penalties as a result of this sweep.

The Bureau found that Low VA Ratesâ advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the
advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually
prepared to offer to consumers, including misrepresenting the annual percentage rate
applicable to the advertised mortgage. Low VA Rates misrepresented the existence, nature,
or amount of cash or credit available to consumers, and used misleading rhetorical
questions, in connection with advertised mortgages. Low VA Rates advertisements also
failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised
mortgage, such as the amount of each payment and time period of payments associated
with consumersâ repayment obligations over the full term of the loan. Low VA Ratesâ
advertisements also misleadingly indicated that its mortgage products could help
consumers eliminate debt. Finally, the Bureau found that Low VA Rates made misleading
comparisons involving actual or hypothetical loan terms in advertisements.

To prevent future violations, the consent order requires Low VA Rates to bolster its
compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance official who must review its
mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to use. The
consent order also prohibits Low VA Rates from making misrepresentations like those
identified by the Bureau through its investigation, and requires Low VA Rates to comply with
certain enhanced disclosure requirements

The consent order against Low VA Rates can be found at:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues DMB Financial, LLC for Allegedly
Violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Consumer Financial Protection Act

DEC 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against DMB Financial, LLC (DMB). The Bureau alleges that DMB violated the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA)
in connection with its debt-settlement and debt-relief services. DMB, which has its principal
place of business in Beverly, Massachusetts, offers to renegotiate, settle, or otherwise alter
the terms of unsecured debts owed by consumers to creditors or debt collectors. The
Bureauâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
seeks an injunction, as well as redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and
the imposition of civil money penalties.

The Bureau alleges that DMB engaged in abusive and deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the TSR. These allegedly unlawful activities include requesting and receiving
fees before it performed its promised services and before consumers started payments
under any debt settlement. The Bureau also alleges that, after settling individual debts,
DMB collected fees based on increased debt amounts after enrollment rather than the
amount of each debt at the time of enrollment.

The Bureau alleges that DMB failed to disclose to consumers before enrollment when it
would make a settlement offer to creditors or debt collectors. In addition, the Bureau
alleges that DMB did not disclose the amount of money or the percentage of each
outstanding debt the consumer had to accumulate before DMB would make a settlement
offer. The Bureau alleges that DMBâs alleged TSR violations also constitute violations of the
CFPA. The Bureau further alleges that DMB misrepresented to consumers that it would not
charge fees for its services until after it settled a debt and consumers made a payment
under the settlement. The Bureau also alleges that DMB misrepresented in its contracts the
debt amount that it would use to determine its fees.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in federal district court in the District of Massachusetts is
available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_dmb-financial-

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Omni Financial of Nevada, Inc.
for Violations of the Military Lending Act, Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and
Consumer Financial Protection Act

DEC 30, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Omni Financial of Nevada, Inc. (Omni). The Bureau found that Omni
violated the Military Lending Act (MLA), Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) in connection with making installment loans. Omni,
which has its principal place of business in Las Vegas, Nevada, and operates using the
names Omni Financial and Omni Military Loans, specializes in lending to consumers
affiliated with the military. It originates tens of thousands of loans each year, with individual
loans typically ranging from $500 to $10,000. The consent order requires that Omni pay a
$2.175 million civil money penalty and imposes injunctive relief to stop ongoing violations
and prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the second in the Bureau's sweep of investigations of multiple lenders that
may be violating the MLA. The MLA puts in place protections in connection with extensions
of consumer credit for active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, who are defined
as âcovered borrowers.â These protections include prohibiting that loans to covered
borrowers be required to be repaid by âallotment.â The Department of Defense runs the
allotment system, which allows servicemembers to designate a portion of their paycheck to
certain recipients. The Bureau found that, since October 2016, Omnis loans to covered
borrowers violated the MLAâs prohibition of requiring repayment by allotment.

The Bureau also found that Omni violated EFTA and the CFPA. In addition to lending to
active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, Omni lends to civilians and non-covered
servicemembers, such as military retirees. The Bureau found that Omni requires all of its
borrowers to provide bank-account information and authorize Omni to withdraw funds from
that account on the first business day after each missed payment. Omni's requirement that
consumers allow it to withdraw funds from their bank accounts violates EFTAâs prohibition
against requiring consumers to preauthorize electronic fund transfers as a condition of
receiving credit. The Bureau further found that these EFTA violations constituted CFPA
violations.

In addition to prohibiting future violations, the consent order requires Omni to provide
notice of the Bureauâs findings to all customers repaying their loans by allotment along with
notice that they may change their repayment method. Omni also must provide training to
employees and is prohibited from providing any incentives to employees or performance
evaluations that consider the number or rate of consumers who choose to repay by
allotment.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Monster Loans, Thomas Chou,
Sean Cowell, and Related Companies

MAY 14, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
proposed stipulated final judgment to resolve its allegations in its lawsuit against California
mortgage lender Chou Team Realty, LLC, which does business as Monster Loans (Monster
Loans), and several individuals and related companies, including Thomas Chou and Sean
Cowell. The Bureau alleged that Chou and Cowell were among the leaders of a scheme to
use Monster Loansâ account with a major credit bureau to unlawfully obtain consumer
reports for their associated student loan debt-relief companies, which in turn used the
consumer reports to deceptively market their services nationwide and then charged
consumers illegal fees. The proposed settlement, if entered by the court, would impose an
$18 million redress judgment against Monster Loans, ban Monster Loans, Chou, and Cowell
from the debt-relief industry, and impose a total $450,001 civil money penalty against them.

The Bureauâs lawsuit alleged that between 2015 and 2017, Monster Loans violated the Fair
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) by obtaining consumer-report information for over 7 million
consumers with student loan debt from a major credit bureau based on the false
representation that the company would use the information to offer mortgage loans to
consumers. Monster Loans allegedly provided the reports to several associated student
loan debt-relief companies to use in marketing their services. The Bureau also alleged that
in 2017 Monster Loans helped create a sham entity called Lend Tech Loans to perpetuate
the scheme to unlawfully obtain consumer reports: Lend Tech Loans purported to be a
mortgage brokerage, but in fact has only ever been used to unlawfully obtain consumer
report information. As alleged in the complaint, because of Monster Loansâ assistance, Lend
Tech Loans was able to wrongfully obtain consumer reports for over 12 million additional
consumers between 2017 and 2019. The Bureau further alleged that, with Monster Loansâ
assistance, the student loan debt-relief companies violated the Consumer Financial
Protection Act (CFPA) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) by making several deceptive
representations about the companiesâ services and violated the TSR by unlawfully collecting
advance fees for debt relief services.

Chou and Cowell were officers of Monster Loans, investors in the student-loan debt relief
companies, and allegedly helped create the sham entity Lend Tech Loans. The Bureau
alleged that they participated in the FCRA violations and then received purported profits
from the student-loan debt-relief companies. As alleged in the complaint, in reality, those
profits represented funds that were wrongfully taken from consumers through unlawful
conduct. If the court approves the proposed settlement, Monster Loans, Chou, and Cowell
will be permanently banned from the debt-relief services industry and subject to limits on
using or obtaining consumer reports, including a ban from using or obtaining prescreened
consumer reports.

If entered by the court, the proposed settlement will also impose a judgment for redress of
$18 million against Monster Loans. As explained in the proposed order, full payment of the
judgment for redress will be suspended subject to Monster Loansâ payment of $200,000 for
consumer redress. The settlement will also require Chou and his company to disgorge
$403,750 in profits for the purpose of providing redress and will impose a judgment for
redress of $406,150 against Cowell and his company, which will be suspended. These
suspended amounts account for certain of these defendantsâ limited ability to pay more
based on sworn financial statements. If the court enters the proposed settlement, Monster
Loans will pay a $1 civil penalty based on its documented inability to pay, Chou will pay a
$350,000 penalty, and Cowell will pay a $100,000 penalty. The penalties will be paid to the
Bureau and deposited in the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund.

The Bureauâs claims against the other defendants and relief defendants in this action,
including Lend Tech Loans, remain pending in the court.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Nissan Motor Acceptance
Corporation for Illegal Collections and Repossession Practices

OCT 13, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (Nissan), an auto financing
subsidiary of Nissan North America, Inc., which services auto loans and leases originated by
Nissan and Infiniti dealerships nationwide. Nissanâs servicing operations are headquartered
in Irving, Texas. The Bureau found that Nissan and its agents: wrongfully repossessed
vehicles; kept personal property in consumersâ repossessed vehicles until consumers paid a
storage fee; deprived consumers paying by phone of the ability to select payment options
with significantly lower fees; and, in its loan extension agreements, made a deceptive
statement that appeared to limit consumersâ bankruptcy protections. These actions violated
the Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against unfair and deceptive
acts and practices. Today's consent order requires Nissan to provide up to $1 million of
cash redress to consumers subject to a wrongful repossession, credit any outstanding
account charges associated with a wrongful repossession, and to pay a civil money penalty
of $4 million. It also imposes certain requirements to prevent future violations and
remediate consumers whose vehicles are wrongfully repossessed going forward.

The Bureau specifically found that, from 2013 through September of 2019, Nissan
repossessed hundreds of consumersâ vehicles despite the consumer having made
payments or otherwise taken actions that should have prevented the repossession. The
Bureau also found that, from at least early 2014 through late August 2017, Nissanâs
repossession agents, with Nissanâs knowledge, demanded that consumers pay a separate,
upfront storage fee for personal property contained in repossessed vehicles. These agents
refused to return consumersâ personal property until the consumers paid the fee.

The Bureau further found that, from 2012 through part of 2017, Nissan deprived consumers
paying by phone of the ability to select pay-by-phone options with significantly lower fees.
Numerous consumers paid $7.95 more to make a phone payment than they would have if
they had known of and selected a different payment option. The Bureau also found that
when Nissan agreed to modify a consumer's loan payments, for tens of thousands of
consumers, Nissan used agreements or written confirmations that included language that
created the net misimpression that consumers could not file for bankruptcy.

The Bureau's consent order requires Nissan to refund fees paid by consumers, credit any
outstanding charges stemming from the repossession, and pay consumers redress for each
day Nissan wrongfully held the car. Nissan must also pay a civil money penalty of $4 million.
The consent order also requires Nissan to prohibit its repossession agents from charging
personal property fees to consumers directly and from demanding fees as a condition of
returning personal property; to correct its repossession practices and conduct a quarterly
review to discover and remediate any future wrongful repossessions; to clearly disclose to
consumers the fee for each method of making a payment by phone before consumers are
asked which method they wish to use; and to stop using any language that creates the
impression that consumers have surrendered their bankruptcy rights.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Arkansas Attorney General Settle with
Home-Alarm Company for Using Consumersâ Credit Scores Without Proper
Notice

DEC 11, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and the
Arkansas Attorney General settled with Alder Holdings, LLC (Alder), resolving their
allegations that Alder failed to provide proper notices under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
(FCRA). Alder is a Utah-based company that sells home-security and alarm systems,
primarily door-to-door, throughout the country and has sold its products and services to
over 115,000 customers. The Bureau and Arkansas filed a proposed stipulated final
judgment and order in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. If
entered by the court, the settlement would require Alder to pay a $600,000 civil money
penalty, $100,000 of which will be offset if Alder pays that amount to settle related litigation
with the State of Arkansas that is currently pending in state court in Arkansas. The settlement
would also require Alder to provide proper notices under FCRA.

The FCRA and its implementing regulation, Regulation V, require companies to give
consumers notice when the companies provide consumers with less favorable credit terms
based on a review of their credit reportsâalso known as risk-based pricing. The complaint
alleged that Alder, in extending credit to its customers for its home-alarm products and
services, charged customers who had lower credit scores higher activation fees, but failed
to provide those customers with the required risk-based pricing notice. Arkansas also
alleged that Alder violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled

which will be paid to the Bureau and deposited into the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund, and
implement procedures to ensure compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act (RESPA) and its implementing regulation, Regulation X.

The Bureau's investigation found that since January 2014, SLS violated RESPA and
Regulation X by taking prohibited foreclosure actions against mortgage borrowers who
were entitled to protection from foreclosure, and by failing to send or to timely send
evaluation notices to mortgage borrowers who were entitled to them. These violations also
constitute violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. In some cases, SLSâs
violations of Regulation X short-circuited the protections against foreclosure for consumers
whose homes were ultimately foreclosed upon.

Under the settlement, SLS will pay $775,000 in restitution to affected consumers according
to a redress plan that the Bureau will approve. SLS will also pay a $250,000 civil money
penalty to the Bureau, and will waive $500,000 in borrower deficiencies. The settlement
requires SLS to implement policies and procedures that will ensure that borrowers receive
the protections from foreclosure to which they are entitled under RESPA and Regulation X,
including preventing SLS from improperly making first filings, from improperly moving for
foreclosure judgments or orders of sale, and from conducting foreclosure sales against
borrowers who have submitted timely and facially complete or complete loss-mitigation
applications. SLS must also monitor its foreclosure activity to ensure that it complies with the
policies and procedures that it must implement.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Seventh Mortgage Company
to Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and
Veterans

SEP 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Accelerate Mortgage, LLC (Accelerate), a Delaware limited liability
corporation that is licensed as a mortgage broker and lender in about 31 states. Accelerate
offers and provides mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA). Accelerateâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is
through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers
and veterans. The Bureau found that Accelerate sent consumers mailers for VA-guaranteed
mortgages that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked
required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices -
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires Accelerate to
pay a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the seventh case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially
unlawful advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of
investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the
financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Accelerate disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, Accelerate advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the interest rate or payment amount applicable
to the advertised mortgage and the nature or amount of cash available to the consumer in
connection with the advertised mortgage. Accelerate also made misrepresentations about
the existence or amount of fees or costs to the consumer in connection with the advertised
mortgage. Accelerate advertisements created the false impression that Accelerate was
affiliated with the government by using words, phrases, images, or designs that are
associated with the VA, Internal Revenue Service, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Accelerate advertisements also falsely represented that the consumer's access to mortgage-
refinance benefits through VA-guaranteed loans was time-limited. The Bureau also found
that Accelerate advertisements failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z,
credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the annual percentage rate of the
advertised mortgage or the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the
loan.

The consent order against Accelerate requires Accelerate to pay a civil penalty of $225,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring Accelerate to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring Accelerate to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Short-term Lenders for
Engaging in Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices

JUN 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau)
announced a settlement with Main Street Personal Finance, Inc. and its subsidiaries-ACAC,
Inc., which conducts business under the name Approved Cash Advance, and Quik Lend,
Inc.-(collectively, Approved Cash). The companies, which are based in Cleveland,
Tennessee, offer payday and auto-title loans and own and operate about 156 stores in eight
different states: Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Tennessee, and Virginia. The Bureau found that Approved Cash provided deceptive finance
charge disclosures in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and the
Truth in Lending Act (TILA), violated the CFPA and TILA by failing to refund overpayments

on its loans, and violated the CFPA by engaging in unfair debt collection practices. The
consent order prohibits Approved Cash from engaging in this unlawful conduct in the
future and requires it to pay consumer redress and a civil money penalty.

Specifically, the Bureau found that Approved Cash violated the CFPAâs prohibition against
engaging in deceptive acts or practices and TILA by concealing and understating the actual
finance charges of its auto-title loans, which are called auto-title pledge transactions under
Mississippi state law, for over 4,000 consumers. Consumers paid a total of over $3.5 million
more than the finance charge listed in Approved Cash's loan disclosures. The Bureau also
found that Approved Cash violated the CFPAâs prohibition against unfair acts or practices
and TILA by retaining consumersâ overpayments on their loans for months and sometimes
years instead of returning those funds to consumers. The Bureau also found that Approved
Cash engaged in unfair debt collection practices in violation of the CFPA when it made
numerous calls to consumersâ workplaces, references, and other third parties after being
asked to stop, and improperly disclosed consumersâ debts to third parties or used tactics
that risked such disclosure.

The consent order imposes a judgment against Approved Cash of approximately $3.5
million in consumer redress, which amount is suspended upon its payment of $2 million of
that judgment and $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau based on Approved Cash's
demonstrated inability to pay. Whenever the Bureau collects a civil money penalty through
an enforcement action, that penalty is deposited into the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund.
Assuming continued available funds, the Bureau will work to provide full relief to eligible
harmed consumers from this fund. The consent order also prohibits Approved Cash from
misrepresenting finance charges in its auto-title pledge transactions, requires it to ensure
that consumers with credit balances over $1 are refunded timely, and prohibits it from
engaging in the same unlawful debt collections practices.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Files Lawsuit Against Driver Loan, LLC And
Its CEO

NOV 05, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
lawsuit against Driver Loan, LLC, and its Chief Executive Officer, Angelo Jose Sarjeant, for
allegedly engaging in deceptive acts or practices in taking deposits from and offering credit
to consumers. Driver Loan, based in Doral, Florida, offers short-term, high-interest loans to
consumers funded by deposits made by other consumers. The Bureau alleges that Driver
Loan and Sarjeant violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by
misrepresenting the risks associated with the deposit product it offered to consumers and
by misrepresenting the annual percentage rate (APR) for extensions of credit it offered to
other consumers.

The Bureauâs complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida, alleges that since 2017, Driver Loan purports to have offered short-term, high-
interest personal loans totaling over $30 million, typically to drivers who work with ride-
share companies. The loans range from $100 to $500 each and are repayable in 15 daily
installments. The Bureau alleges that Driver Loan deceptively markets its loans as having an
APR of 440% when the actual APRs are about 975%.

In 2020, Driver Loan began taking deposits from consumers to fund the loans it makes.
Driver Loan claims to guarantee a 15% annual percentage yield on consumersâ deposits. It
also claims to guarantee that consumersâ deposits are held at FDIC-insured institutions,
which would protect against the loss of insured deposits. Driver Loanâs website also
represents that a new consumer deposits funds with the company about every minute. The
Bureau alleges that Driver Loanâs representations are false, as many consumersâ funds were
not held in FDIC-insured accounts, the rate of return was not âguaranteed,â and other
consumers were not rushing to deposit their funds with Driver Loan. The Bureau also
alleges that most deposited funds are lent to borrowers at rates that violate Floridaâs
criminal-usury law, rendering the loans uncollectable and creating substantial risk that
Driver Loan would not be able to collect delinquent loans or meet its obligations to
consumers who sought to withdraw their deposited funds.

The Bureau seeks an injunction against Driver Loan and Sarjeant to stop their alleged
unlawful conduct, as well as damages, redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten
gains, and the imposition of civil money penalties.

The Bureau's complaint is not a finding or ruling that Driver Loan, LLC or Angelo Jose
Sarjeant has violated the law.

A copy of the complaint is available here:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Multiple States Enter Into Settlement
with Owner of ITT Private Loans for Substantially Assisting ITT in Unfair Practices

SEP 15, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
proposed stipulated judgment against PEAKS Trust 2009-1, along with Deutsche Bank
National Trust Company, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Delaware, and Deutsche Bank
Trust Company Americas, in their capacity as trustees to PEAKS Trust 2009-1 (collectively,
âPEAKS""). In its complaint, filed in the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, the
Bureau alleged that PEAKS provided substantial assistance to ITT Educational Services, Inc.
(ITT) in engaging in unfair acts and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010. PEAKS owned and managed private loans for students at ITT
Technical Institute. PEAKS allegedly knew or was reckless in not knowing that many student
borrowers did not understand the terms and conditions of those loans, could not afford
them, or in some cases did not even know they had them. If entered by the court, the
proposed judgment will require PEAKS to forgive all of its outstanding loansâapproximately
$330 million in debt- for about 35,000 borrowers who currently have outstanding principal
balances. Forty-seven states plus the District of Columbia have also settled with PEAKS
today.

ITT operated ITT Technical Institute until it filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in
2016. The Bureau filed suit against ITT in February, 2014, alleging that ITT engaged in
unlawful acts and practices to push students into private student loans in a scheme to
improve the appearance of ITTâs financial statements and its standing among investors. To
this end, ITT developed two private loan programs, the Student CU Connect CUSO, LLC
(CUSO) and PEAKS loan programs. Despite knowledge that the default rate on these loans
would be high-and in fact defaults reached in excess of 94 percent and 80 percent for the
two private loan programs-ITT and its partners pressed on, issuing high cost loans to
students in order to temporarily improve ITTâs balance sheet. In the end, while ITTâs partners
were paid guarantee payments by ITT to cover much of their losses, ITT students were left
saddled with high cost loans, derogatory information on their credit reports, or both.

The Bureau's complaint against PEAKS alleged that ITT arranged for the PEAKS loans to be
serviced and collected on after ITT had induced its students to take out the loans by a
variety of unfair practices, including rushing students through financial aid appointments,
using aggressive tactics, and in some cases, gaining unauthorized access to student
accounts to sign students up for loans without permission. The Bureau alleged that PEAKS
was actively involved in servicing and managing the PEAKS loan program, including the
collection of the loans, and that PEAKSâs conduct constituted substantial assistance of ITTâs
unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA.

If entered by the court, the proposed stipulated judgment would require PEAKS to stop
collecting on all outstanding PEAKS loans, discharge all outstanding PEAKS loans, and ask
all consumer reporting agencies to which PEAKS furnished information to delete
information relating to PEAKS loans. The order would also require PEAKS to provide notice
to all consumers with outstanding PEAKS loans that their debt has been discharged and is
no longer owed and that PEAKS is seeking to have the relevant consumer reporting
information deleted. The total amount of loan forgiveness is currently estimated to be $330
million, for about 35,000 consumers with outstanding balances owed on their PEAKS loans.

Todayâs settlement with PEAKS marks the third settlement by the Bureau related to ITTâs
private loan programs. On June 14, 2019, the Bureau announced a settlement with CUSO,
another company that had been set up to hold and manage a separate portfolio of private
loans for ITT students. Under that settlement, the CUSO was required to discharge
approximately $168 million in loans. The settlements with CUSO and PEAKS combined
provide nearly $500 million in private student-loan debt-relief to former ITT students and
permanently put an end to the collection of the loans originated under these two private
loan programs established by ITT.

cuso-over-itt-private-loan-program/ (cfpb.gov/about-us/newsroom/bureau-settles-student-
cu-connect-cuso-over-itt-private-loan-program/)

 

 

In addition, on August 12, 2019, the Bureau announced a settlement in its lawsuit against
ITT Educational Services, which included a judgment against ITT for $60 million and an
injunction prohibiting ITT from offering or providing student loans in the future. Information

 (itt) in engaging in unfair acts and practices in violation of the consumer financial protection act of 2010. peaks owned and managed private loans for students at itt technical institute. peaks allegedly knew or was reckless in not knowing that many student borrowers did not understand the terms and conditions of those loans, could not afford them, or in some cases did not even know they had them. if entered by the court, the proposed judgment will require peaks to forgive all of its outstanding loansapproximately $330 million in debt- for about 35,000 borrowers who currently have outstanding principal balances. forty-seven states plus the district of columbia have also settled with peaks today.
 itt operated itt technical institute until it filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 2016. the bureau filed suit against itt in february, 2014, alleging that itt engaged in unlawful acts and practices to push students into private student loans in a scheme to improve the appearance of itt's financial statements and its standing among investors. to this end, itt developed two private loan programs, the student cu connect cuso, llc (cuso) and peaks loan programs. despite knowledge that the default rate on these loans would be high-and in fact defaults reached in excess of 94 percent and 80 percent for the two private loan programs-itt and its partners pressed on, issuing high cost loans to students in order to temporarily improve itt's balance sheet. in the end, while itt's partners were paid guarantee payments by itt to cover much of their losses, itt students were left saddled with high cost loans, derogatory information on their credit reports, or both.
 the bureau's complaint against peaks alleged that itt arranged for the peaks loans to be serviced and collected on after itt had induced its students to take out the loans by a variety of unfair practices, including rushing students through financial aid appointments, using aggressive tactics, and in some cases, gaining unauthorized access to student accounts to sign students up for loans without permission. the bureau alleged that peaks was actively involved in servicing and managing the peaks loan program, including the collection of the loans, and that peaks's conduct constituted substantial assistance of itt's unfair acts and practices in violation of the cfpa.
 if entered by the court, the proposed stipulated judgment would require peaks to stop collecting on all outstanding peaks loans, discharge all outstanding peaks loans, and ask all consumer reporting agencies to which peaks furnished information to delete information relating to peaks loans. the order would also require peaks to provide notice to all consumers with outstanding peaks loans that their debt has been discharged and is no longer owed and that peaks is seeking to have the relevant consumer reporting information deleted. the total amount of loan forgiveness is currently estimated to be $330 million, for about 35,000 consumers with outstanding balances owed on their peaks loans.
 today's settlement with peaks marks the third settlement by the bureau related to itt's private loan programs. on june 14, 2019, the bureau announced a settlement with cuso, another company that had been set up to hold and manage a separate portfolio of private loans for itt students. under that settlement, the cuso was required to discharge approximately $168 million in loans. the settlements with cuso and peaks combined provide nearly $500 million in private student-loan debt-relief to former itt students and permanently put an end to the collection of the loans originated under these two private loan programs established by itt.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Student-Loan Debt-Relief Operation
for Taking Illegal Advance Fees and Settles with Some Participants

JUL 13, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
complaint in the federal district court for the Central District of California against GST
Factoring, Inc., which runs a student-loan debt-relief business in Texas, and two of its
owners, Rick Graff and Gregory Trimarche, as well as Champion Marketing Solutions, LLC, a
customer service and marketing company, and its owner, Scott Freda. The Bureau also filed
suit against four attorneys, California attorneys Amanda Johanson and Jacob Slaughter,
Arizona attorney David Mize, and Florida attorney Daniel Ruggiero. The Bureau alleges that
the companies, their owners, and the attorneys were part of a nationwide student-loan
debt-relief operation that charged thousands of consumers saddled with private student-
loan debt approximately $11.8 million in illegal upfront fees in violation of the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). Concurrent with the complaint, the Bureau and four of the
defendants filed proposed stipulated final judgments and orders to resolve the claims
against them. If entered by the court, the orders will ban Trimarche, Slaughter, Mize, and
Ruggiero from participating in certain activities, impose monetary judgments to provide
consumer redress totaling approximately $11.8 million, and impose a civil money penalty.

Under the TSR, it is illegal to request or receive any fees for debt-relief services sold through
telemarketing before the debt is settled or renegotiated. But, as the complaint alleges, from
2015 through the present, the defendants violated the TSRâs prohibition on requesting or
receiving advance fees for debt-relief services, or substantially assisted others in violating
this prohibition by charging illegal advance fees purportedly to renegotiate student loan
debt. As the complaint alleges, the defendants did not wait to complete their work for
consumers, and instead charged fees right away by arranging for monthly payments over
the course of years that began at or just after consumers signed up for defendantsâ services.
Using telemarketing campaigns, the debt-relief operation led consumers to believe that
they were working solely with an attorney, but in fact, the feesâwhich were as large as about
40 percent of the consumersâ outstanding student-loan debtâwent to defendant GST
Factoring, which distributed the funds to the participants in the scheme. The complaint also
alleges that consumers were encouraged to stop paying their student loans all together.

The Bureau negotiated proposed stipulated final judgments and orders with four of the
defendants that were filed alongside the complaint. If entered by the court, the proposed
orders will permanently ban Trimarche from providing debt-relief services and
telemarketing any consumer financial product or service and impose permanent debt-relief
bans on Slaughter, Mize, and Ruggiero. The proposed orders would also impose monetary
judgments against the settling defendants to provide redress to the approximately 2,600
consumers who paid a total of approximately $11.8 million to the defendants over the
course of nearly five years. The full judgment amount will be suspended upon the settling
defendantsâ paying a portion of the redress based on their demonstrated inability to pay the
full amount. Each settling defendant will also pay a $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau.
Whenever the Bureau collects a civil money penalty through an enforcement action, that
penalty is deposited into the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. Assuming continued available
funds, the Bureau will work to provide full relief to eligible harmed consumers from this
fund.

If the proposed orders are entered by the Court, the Bureauâs lawsuit would continue to
proceed against Defendants GST Factoring, Champion Marketing Solutions, Graff, Freda,
and Johanson. The complaint seeks redress to consumers, an injunction, and the imposition
of civil money penalties against them. The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the
defendants have violated the law.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Files Suit Against Mortgage Creditor for
Discriminatory Mortgage-Lending Practices

JUL 15, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
lawsuit against Townstone Financial, Inc., a nonbank retail-mortgage creditor based in
Chicago, for violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA); its implementing
regulation, Regulation B; and the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). ECOA and
Regulation B prohibit mortgage lenders from discriminating against applicants in credit
transactions on the basis of race, color, national origin, or other prohibited bases. ECOA
and Regulation B also prohibit mortgage lenders from making statements, or engaging in
acts or practices, that would discourage, on a prohibited basis, applicants or prospective
applicants from applying for credit. The Bureau's complaint alleges that Townstone violated
ECOA and Regulation B by engaging in discriminatory mortgage-lending practices and that
these violations also constituted violations of the CFPA.

As alleged in the complaint, from 2014 through 2017, Townstone drew almost no
applications for properties in African-American neighborhoods located in the Chicago-
Naperville-Elgin Metropolitan Statistical Area (Chicago MSA) and few applications from
African Americans throughout the Chicago MSA. The Bureau's complaint, filed in federal
district court in the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that:

=Â» Townstone engaged in acts or practices, including making statements during its weekly
radio shows and podcasts through which it marketed its services, that illegally discouraged
prospective African-American applicants from applying to Townstone for mortgage loans;

= Townstone engaged in illegal redlining by engaging in acts or practices that discouraged
prospective applicants living in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA from
applying to Townstone for mortgage loans, including by making discouraging statements
during its weekly radio shows and podcasts through which it marketed its services; and

=Â» Townstone engaged in illegal redlining by engaging in acts or practices that discouraged
prospective applicants living in other areas from applying to Townstone for mortgage loans
for properties located in African-American neighborhoods in the Chicago MSA, including
by making discouraging statements during its weekly radio shows and podcasts through
which it marketed its services.

The Bureau's complaint seeks an injunction against Townstone, as well as damages, redress
to consumers, and the imposition of a civil money penalty.

The Bureau's complaint is not a finding or ruling that Townstone has violated the law.

Northern District of Illinois is available here:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with SMART Payment Plan, LLC for
Deceptive Sales Practices

NOV 02, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against SMART Payment Plan, LLC (SMART), finding that the companyâs
disclosures of its loan payment program contained misleading statements in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices.
SMART is a limited liability company with its principal place of business in Austin, Texas.
SMART operates a loan payment program for auto loans called the SMART Plan that
deducts payments from consumersâ bank accounts every two weeks and then forwards
these payments every month to the consumersâ lenders. The consent order imposes a
judgment against SMART requiring it to pay $7,500,000 in consumer redress and
requirements to prevent future violations.

SMART provided consumers individualized âbenefits summariesâ that purported to state a
specific amount of interest savings or other money savings consumers would get by
enrolling in the SMART Plan, but SMARTâs fees would ordinarily exceed the savings.
SMART's disclosures thus created the misleading impression that consumers would save
money using its product.

The ordered redress amount is suspended upon SMARTâs payment of $1,500,000 by
December 31, 2020 and a $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau. The suspension of the full
payment for redress, as well as the $1 civil penalty, is based on SMARTâs demonstrated
inability to pay more based on sworn financial statements. Harmed consumers may be
eligible for additional relief from the Bureauâs Civil Penalty Fund. The consent order
prohibits SMART from making any misrepresentations about its payment programs. It also
requires SMART to account for the total costs for its payment programs, as well as the net
savings or costs after deducting any fees, whenever SMART makes claims about savings or
financial benefits.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Short-Term Lender for Unfair
and Deceptive Acts and Practices

APR 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau)
announced a settlement with Cottonwood Financial, Ltd., which does business under the
name Cash Store. Cash Store is based in Irving, Texas and owns and operates roughly 340
retail lending outlets in Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Wisconsin.
The Bureau found that in the course of marketing, servicing, and collecting on high-interest
payday, auto-title, and unsecured consumer-installment loans Cash Store violated the
Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and Truth in
Lending Act (TILA). The consent order requires Cash Store to pay over $1.3 million in
redress and penalties.

Specifically, the Bureau found that Cash Store made deceptive representations in its
television advertisements and telemarketing calls when promoting â50%-off"" all of its loan
fees when it did not in fact provide that discount. Cash Store engaged in unfair practices by
repeatedly calling consumersâ workplaces and references after being asked to stop and not
for purposes of locating consumers, disclosing the delinquency of consumersâ debts to third
parties or using tactics that risked such disclosure, and making excessive calls to consumers
that aggravated, annoyed, and distressed consumers. Cash Store violated the FCRA by
failing to maintain adequate policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity
of the information it furnished to consumer reporting agencies, potentially affecting about
20,000 consumer accounts. Cash Store also violated TILA by failing to provide the annual
percentage rate to consumers when they inquired over the phone about the cost of their
loans.

The consent order issued against Cash Store requires it to provide $286,675.64 in redress
to over 1,200 borrowers whom Cash Store falsely promised 50% off all fees. The consent
order requires Cash Store to pay a civil money penalty of $1,100,000 to the Bureauâs Civil
Penalty Fund. The consent order also prohibits Cash Store from certain collection practices
and requires it to ensure that its employees respond accurately when asked about loan
costs.

 the consent order issued against cash store requires it to provide $286,675.64 in redress to over 1,200 borrowers whom cash store falsely promised 50% off all fees. the consent order requires cash store to pay a civil money penalty of $1,100,000 to the bureau's civil penalty fund. the consent order also prohibits cash store from certain collection practices and requires it to ensure that its employees respond accurately when asked about loan costs.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Settlement with Debt
Collector for Credit Reporting Violation

NOV 12, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today
announced a settlement with Afni, Inc. (Afni) to address its violations in providing
information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs). Afni is a non-bank Illinois-based debt
collector that specializes in collecting debt on behalf of telecommunications companies and
furnishes information to consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) about consumersâ credit. The
consent order requires Afni to take certain steps to prevent future violations and imposes a
$500,000 civil money penalty.

The Bureau found that Afni furnished information to CRAs that it knew or had reasonable
cause to believe was inaccurate and failed to report to CRAs an appropriate date of first
delinquency on certain accounts. The Bureau also found that Afni failed to conduct
reasonable investigations of disputes made by consumers both to Afni and to CRAs about
furnished information and failed to conduct investigations of disputes made to Afni in a
timely manner. In addition, the Bureau found that Anfi failed to send required notices to
consumers about the results of such investigations and failed to establish, implement, and
update its policies and procedures regarding its furnishing of consumer information to
CRAs. Afniâs conduct violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its implementing
rule, Regulation V and, by engaging in these violations of the FCRA and Regulation V, Afni
violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

Under the terms of the consent order, Afni must take certain steps to improve and ensure
the accuracy of its furnishing of consumer information to CRAs and its policies and
procedures relating to credit reporting and dispute investigation. These required steps
include conducting monthly reviews of account information to assess the accuracy and
integrity of information it furnishes. Afni must also conduct monthly reviews of consumer
disputes and responses to assess whether its handling of consumer disputes complies with
the FCRA, Regulation V, and its own policies and procedures. The consent order also
requires Afni to retain an independent consultant to conduct a review of Afniâs activities,
policies, and procedures relating to furnishing information and credit reporting to ensure
that its current policies, practices, and procedures regarding furnishing of consumer
information to CRAs comply with the FCRA and Regulation V.

The consent order is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_afni-

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Takes Action Against Student-Loan Debt-
Relief Business and Its Owners for Taking Illegal Advance Fees

JUL 08, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled with
Timemark, Inc., a company based in Deerfield Beach, Florida, that provides debt-relief
services to consumers with federal student-loan debt, and with its owners and officers,
Timothy Lenihan, Sr., Mark Nagler, and Casey Gassaway. The Bureau alleged that the
defendants charged illegal advance fees in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR)
to consumers who were seeking to renegotiate, settle, reduce, or alter the terms of their
loans. If entered by the court, the proposed order memorializing the settlement will
permanently ban defendants from providing debt-relief services and impose a judgment
totaling approximately $3.8 million in consumer redress and civil money penalties.

The Bureau's complaint, which was filed in federal district court for the Southern District of
Florida, alleged that from 2016 through October 2019, the defendants used telemarketing
campaigns to convince more than 7,300 consumers to pay up to $699 in fees to file
paperwork to reduce or eliminate their monthly payments for their federal student loans,
through loan consolidation, forgiveness, or income-driven repayment plans. The U.S.
Department of Education, however, offers these options to student loan borrowers for free.
Moreover, under the TSR, it is illegal to request or receive any fees for debt-relief services
sold through telemarketing before the terms of the debt are altered or settled, and the
consumer has made at least one payment pursuant to the new arrangement. The Bureau
alleges that the defendants violated the TSR because they requested and received
payments from consumers within a few days, or at the latest, within 30 days of their
enrollmentâbefore the terms of the debts were altered.

If entered by the court, under the terms of the proposed order, the defendants would be
permanently banned from providing debt-relief services. The order would impose a
judgment on the defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of about $3.8 million for
consumer redress. Full payment of this amount will be suspended if, within 10 days after the
order is entered, Timemark pays $5,000, Nagler pays $7,000, and Gassaway pays $10,000.
The full amount of redress was suspended because of defendantsâ limited ability to pay
more based on sworn financial statements. The defendants would also be required to each
pay a $1 civil money penalty, in light of their financial circumstances. Whenever the Bureau
collects a civil money penalty through an enforcement action, that penalty is deposited into
the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. Assuming continued available funds, the Bureau will work
to provide full redress to eligible harmed consumers from this fund.

The CFPB complaint is available at:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Fifth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Hypotec, Inc., a mortgage broker based in Miami, Florida that is
licensed in eight states. Hypotec offers and provides mortgage loans guaranteed by the
United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Hypotec advertises its VA-guaranteed
loans to United States military servicemembers and veterans through direct-mail
advertisements. The Bureau found that in advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages Hypotec
sent consumers numerous mailers that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate
statements or that lacked required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial
Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts
and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires
Hypotec to pay a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future
violations.

Todayâs action is the fifth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.
The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of investigations
reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the financial

marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers, veterans, and
surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that, since 2016, Hypotec disseminated advertisements that contained
false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures.
For example, Hypotec advertised specific credit terms, such as interest rates, APRs, and
hypothetical payment amounts that it was not prepared to offer, or that it could only offer
for an introductory period but advertised as if they were permanent loan terms. Hypotecâs
advertisements also used phrasing and formatting that falsely represented or implied that
Hypotec was affiliated with the government, including the VA, that the advertised product
was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the United States government, or that the
United States government was the source of the advertisements. In addition, in
advertisements mailed between June 2016 and January 2019, Hypotec stated that it would
pay an estimated escrow refund of a specific amount if the consumer refinanced through
Hypotec, even though the advertised escrow refund amount was calculated using a method
that would not yield an actual estimate for that consumer, and customers were required to
fund escrow accounts upon generating a new loan. Its advertisements also falsely stated:
âthe Economic Stimulus Program will end soon. There is currently no plan to extend the
Stimulus Program.â Finally, many Hypotec advertisements included claims or terms that
require additional disclosures, but Hypotec failed to make these disclosures.

The consent order against Hypotec requires Hypotec to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. The
consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring
Hypotec to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance
official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage
advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those identified
by the Bureau; and requiring Hypotec to comply with certain enhanced disclosure
requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Debt Collector for Engaging in
Deceptive Debt Collection Practices in Three States

DEC 08, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against RAB Performance Recoveries, LLC (RAB) for threatening to sue and
suing consumers to collect debts where it did not have a legally required license to do so.
Through 2012, RAB, a New Jersey company, purchased and collected consumer debts from
debt brokers, and through August 2014, it used collections law firms to obtain judgments
against consumers. RAB has continued to collect on those judgments against consumers as
well as on a handful of payment agreements it obtained from debtors. The Bureau found
that during the period that RAB was obtaining judgments against consumers, RAB
threatened to sue, sued, and demanded payment from consumers in Connecticut, New
Jersey, and Rhode Island even though RAB did not hold the licenses that those states
required to sue to collect debts. Thus, RAB was not legally entitled to take the actions that it
threatened to take against consumers in those states. The Bureau found that RAB
misrepresented that it had a legally enforceable right to recover payments from consumers
in these states through the judicial process in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA).

The consent order prohibits RAB from collecting on the judgments against, or payment
agreements from, consumers it obtained in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Rhode Island
when RAB did not hold a required debt-collection license in those states. It also requires
RAB to take all necessary steps to vacate those judgments and suspend collection of those
judgments and to notify consumers with payment agreements that they have been satisfied.
The consent order also requires RAB to pay a $204,000 civil money penalty.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Files Suit Against Loan Doctor and Edgar
Radjabli for Deceptive Acts and Practices in Marketing a Savings CD Account

JUL 06, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
lawsuit against My Loan Doctor LLC, a Delaware financial-services company operating in
West Palm Beach, Florida and New York City and doing business as Loan Doctor (Loan
Doctor), and its founder, Edgar Radjabli. The Bureau alleges that Loan Doctor and Radjabli
made several false, misleading, and inaccurate marketing representations in advertising
Loan Doctor's âHealthcare Finance (HCF) Savings CD Account,â in violation of the Consumer
Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. As the
Bureau's complaint alleges, starting in August 2019, Loan Doctor took more than $15
million from at least 400 consumers who opened and deposited money into Loan Doctor's
deceptively advertised product.

The Bureauâs complaint, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of New York,
specifically alleges that Loan Doctor and Radjabli engaged in four separate deceptive acts
or practices in violation of the CFPA.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that the money consumers deposited into
Loan Doctor's HCF High Yield CD Accounts would be used to originate loans for healthcare
professionals and that Loan Doctor, before making a loan, would have an investor lined up
to purchase it after it was made; in fact, Loan Doctor never used the deposits to originate
loans for healthcare professionals and never entered into a contract with a buyer or investor
to purchase a loan.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that the money consumers deposited into
Loan Doctor's HCF High Yield CD Accounts, when not being used to originate loans, would
be held in an FDIC-insured account, an account insured by Lloydâs of London, or a âcash
alternativeâ or âcash equivalent,â and, further, that Loan Doctor would maintain a cash
reserve in an amount âequivalent toâ the amount consumers deposited; in fact, consumersâ
deposits were invested in actively traded securities or loaned, through a third party, to
investors using individual stock portfolios as collateral.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that Loan Doctor was a commercial bank and
that consumersâ deposits were safe and comparable to a traditional savings account with a
guaranteed return; in fact, Loan Doctor was not a commercial bank, and consumersâ
deposits were invested in volatile securities or securities-backed investments.

= Loan Doctor and Radjabli falsely represented that Loan Doctor's HCF High Yield CD
Accounts paid interest at rates between 5 percent and 6.25 percent in the years before
2019; in fact, Loan Doctor did not even begin taking consumer deposits until August 2019.

The Bureau seeks redress for consumers, an injunction, and the imposition of civil money
penalties.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York is available here: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_loan-
doctor_complaint_2020-07.pdf YW (cfpb.gov/documents/8969/cfob_loan-doctor_complaint_

 the bureau's complaint, filed in federal district court in the southern district of new york, specifically alleges that loan doctor and radjabli engaged in four separate deceptive acts or practices in violation of the cfpa.
 = loan doctor and radjabli falsely represented that the money consumers deposited into loan doctor's hcf high yield cd accounts would be used to originate loans for healthcare professionals and that loan doctor, before making a loan, would have an investor lined up to purchase it after it was made; in fact, loan doctor never used the deposits to originate loans for healthcare professionals and never entered into a contract with a buyer or investor to purchase a loan.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Remittance Transfer Providers
for Remittance Transfer Rule Violations

AUG 31, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) entered
into settlements with Trans-Fast Remittance LLC and Sigue Corporation and its subsidiaries,
SGS Corporation and GroupEx Corporation. Trans-Fast, which until recently was a
remittance transfer provider, is based in New York, New York and licensed in over 30 states.
Sigue and its subsidiaries, which are all headquartered in Sylmar, California, provide
consumers with international money-transfer services, including remittance-transfer
services. The Bureau found that Trans-Fast and Sigue and its subsidiaries violated the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the Remittance Transfer Rule, which implements
EFTA. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act
of 2010's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. The consent orders require
the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose requirements to prevent future
violations. Sigue and its subsidiaries must also pay consumer redress. These actions reflect a
sweep of enforcement actions to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.

The Bureauâs investigation of Trans-Fast found that it violated EFTA and the Remittance
Transfer Rule by failing to adhere to error resolution requirements and properly respond to
cancellation requests, failing to provide refunds the Remittance Transfer Rule requires,
failing to maintain required policies and procedures, and failing to provide required
disclosures. Since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, Trans-Fast
provided about 40 million disclosures to consumers that violated the Remittance Transfer
Rule. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA by making misleading statements in advertisements regarding the
speed of its remittance transfers and making misleading statements in disclosures
purporting to limit consumersâ error resolution rights.

The Bureauâs investigation of Sigue and its subsidiaries found that between 2013 and 2019,
they violated EFTA and the Remittance Transfer Rule. Specifically, the Bureau found that
Sigue and its subsidiaries failed to refund transaction fees when they did not make funds
available by the disclosed date of availability, and they failed to inform consumers of the
remedies available for remittance errors. When Sigue and its subsidiaries investigated
remittance errors, they failed to report to consumers in writing the results of their
investigations into transaction errors or consumersâ rights as required by the Rule. Sigue
and its subsidiaries also failed to develop and maintain adequate written policies and
procedures designed to ensure compliance with certain Remittance Transfer Rule error-
resolution requirements and failed to comply with several Remittance Transfer Rule
disclosure requirements.

The consent order against Trans-Fast requires it to pay a $1.6 million civil money penalty. If
Trans-Fast resumes offering remittance transfers, the consent order requires it to adopt a
compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply with all
applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order.

The consent order against Sigue and its subsidiaries requires them to pay about $100,000
in consumer redress and a $300,000 civil money penalty. They must also implement and
maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the
Remittance Transfer Rule and maintain a compliance-management system that is designed
to ensure that their operations comply with the Remittance Transfer Rule, including
conducting training and oversight of all agents, employees, and service providers, and not
violating the Remittance Transfer Rule in the future.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, South Carolina, and Arkansas File Suit
Against Brokers of High-Interest Credit Offers

FEB 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), the South
Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs (South Carolina), and Arkansas Attorney General
Leslie Rutledge today filed a lawsuit in federal district court in the District of South Carolina
against Candy Kern-Fuller, Howard Sutter Ill, and Upstate Law Group LLC. The Bureau
alleges that the defendants worked with a series of companies that brokered contracts
offering high-interest credit to consumers, primarily disabled veterans, and violated the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices and
against providing substantial assistance to deceptive and unfair acts or practices of others.

Todayâs action builds on a number of recent Bureau actions against other entities that used
similar contracts and similar marketing tactics in offering high-interest credit to veterans. In
January 2019, the Bureau settled with Mark Corbett. In August 2019, in partnership with
Arkansas, the Bureau settled with Andrew Gamber; Voyager Financial Group, LLC; BAIC,
Inc.; and SoBell Corp. In October 2019, in partnership with South Carolina, the Bureau filed
a lawsuit against Katharine Snyder and her companies, Performance Arbitrage Company,
Inc. and Life Funding Options, Inc. Corbett worked with both Gamber and Snyder, and their
respective companies, to broker contracts offering high-interest credit. In each of these
actions, the Bureau alleged that these contracts violate laws that prohibit these transactions
and render them void, contrary to the representations made by Corbett, Gamber, Snyder,
and their companies that the transactions were valid and enforceable. In these actions, the
Bureau also alleged that the companies misrepresented to consumers that the product is a
sale of payments and not a high-interest credit offer and failed to inform consumers of the
productsâ interest rates. To date, the Bureau Civil Penalty Fund has allocated about $9
million to consumers harmed by Corbett's actions and about $2.7 million to those harmed
by Gamberâs actions.

In todayâs action, the Bureau, South Carolina, and Arkansas allege that the defendants
assisted Gamber, Snyder, and their companies. The Bureau specifically alleges that the
defendants provided substantial assistance to the companiesâ deceptive and unfair acts or
practices by: developing a pre-approval or risk-assessment process for the contracts and
conducting underwriting; approving or denying consumersâ applications to enter into the
transactions; directing and administering the execution of the contracts; serving as the
payment processor for the initial lump-sum payment and fees; and continuing to serve as
the transactionsâ payment processor. In addition, the Bureau alleges that the defendants
provided substantial assistance to deceptive misrepresentations by Gamberâs and Snyder's
companies to consumers that consumers may be subject to criminal prosecution if they
breached their contacts when, in fact, the consumers could not be criminally prosecuted for
breaching their contracts. The Bureau also alleges that the defendants committed deceptive
acts or practices by collecting on the contracts brokered by the companies, including by
filing suit when consumers failed to make payments, and representing, expressly or
impliedly, that consumers are legally obligated to make payments in accordance with the
terms of their contracts when, in fact, the contracts are void from inception and consumers
are not obligated to make payments. The complaint seeks an injunction, redress to
consumers, and the imposition of civil money penalties.

The Bureauâs investigation was conducted in partnership with South Carolina and Arkansas.
The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of South
Carolina is available here: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_kern-
fuller_complaint_2020-02.pdf WY (cfpb.gov/documents/8532/cfpb_kern-fuller_complaint_20

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Debt Collector BounceBack, Inc.

DEC 09, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â- Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against BounceBack, Inc. for allegedly engaging in deceptive and otherwise
unlawful debt collection acts or practices. BounceBack, based in Kansas City, Missouri,
operates bad-check pretrial-diversion programs on behalf of more than 90 district
attorneysâ offices throughout the United States. The Bureau alleges that in the course of
implementing this program, BounceBack violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureauâs
complaint seeks injunctions against BounceBack, as well as damages, redress to consumers,
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of a civil money penalty.

The Bureau filed its complaint in federal court in the Western District of Missouri. The
complaint alleges that since at least 2015, in the course of administering these bad-check
pretrial-diversion programs, BounceBack used district-attorney letterheads to threaten
more than 19,000 consumers with prosecution if they did not pay the amount of the check,
enroll and pay for a financial-education course, and pay various other fees. BounceBack did
not reveal to consumers that BounceBackâand not district attorneysâsent the letters. Nor
did BounceBack reveal that district attorneys almost never prosecuted these cases, even
when consumers ignored BounceBackâs threats. In fact, in most cases, BounceBack did not
refer cases for prosecution, even if the check writer failed to respond to its collection letter.
BounceBackâs letters also failed to include disclosures required under the FDCPA. The
Bureau alleges that BounceBackâs conduct violated the FDCPA, was deceptive under both
the FDCPA and the CFPA, and that its violations of the FDCPA constituted violations of the
CFPA.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendant has violated the law.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Third Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

AUG 21, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Go Direct Lenders, Inc. (Go Direct), a California corporation that is
licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 11 states. Go Direct offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Go
Direct's principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that Go Direct sent consumers numerous mailers for VA-guaranteed
mortgages that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked
required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices -
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires Go Direct to pay
a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the third case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.

On July 24, 2020, the Bureau announced consent orders against Sovereign Lending Group,
Inc., and Prime Choice Funding, Inc., both California corporations, for similar violations. The
Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising
provides consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and
terms available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This
ongoing sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws
that ensure the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including
servicemembers, veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are
designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Go Direct disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, Go Direct advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including advertising a lower annual percentage rate than it was prepared
to offer. Go Direct also made misrepresentations about the applicable fees in connection
with the advertised mortgage. Go Direct advertisements misleadingly described variable-
rate loans as âfixedâ rate loans, when in fact the rate was adjustable and could increase over
time. Go Direct advertisements falsely stated or implied that an appraisal, assets, and
income documentation were not required to qualify for certain loans and that consumers
with FICO scores as low as 500 would qualify for the advertised rates.

The Bureau also found that Go Direct advertisements falsely represented that it had records
showing that the value of the consumer's property had increased over the past year by a
specific percentage. Go Direct advertisements created the false impression that Go Direct
was affiliated with the government by using words, phrases, images, or design
characteristics that are associated with the VA or the Internal Revenue Service. Further, Go
Direct advertisements failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit
terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the
full term of the loan.

The consent order against Go Direct requires Go Direct to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring Go Direct to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring Go Direct to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

 the bureau found that go direct disseminated advertisements that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. for example, go direct advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer to the consumer, including advertising a lower annual percentage rate than it was prepared to offer. go direct also made misrepresentations about the applicable fees in connection with the advertised mortgage. go direct advertisements misleadingly described variable- rate loans as ""fixed"" rate loans, when in fact the rate was adjustable and could increase over time. go direct advertisements falsely stated or implied that an appraisal, assets, and income documentation were not required to qualify for certain loans and that consumers with fico scores as low as 500 would qualify for the advertised rates.
 the bureau also found that go direct advertisements falsely represented that it had records showing that the value of the consumer's property had increased over the past year by a specific percentage. go direct advertisements created the false impression that go direct was affiliated with the government by using words, phrases, images, or design characteristics that are associated with the va or the internal revenue service. further, go direct advertisements failed to properly disclose, when required by regulation z, credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan.
 the consent order against go direct requires go direct to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.
 the consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring go direct to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those identified by the bureau; and requiring go direct to comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and New York Attorney General Take
Action Against Debt-Collection Operation and Its Owners and Managers

SEP 08, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), in partnership
with the New York Attorney General (NYAG), today filed suit against a network of five
different companies based outside of Buffalo, New York, two of their owners, and two of
their managers, for their participation in a debt-collection operation using illegal methods
to collect debts. The company defendants are: JPL Recovery Solutions, LLC; Regency One
Capital LLC; ROC Asset Solutions LLC, which does business as API Recovery Solutions;
Check Security Associates LLC, which does business as Warner Location Services and
Orchard Payment Processing Systems; and Keystone Recovery Group. The individual
defendants are Christopher Di Re and Scott Croce, who have held ownership interests in
some or all of the defendant companies, and Brian Koziel and Marc Gracie, who are
members of Keystone Recovery Group, and have acted as managers of some or all of the
defendant companies. The complaint alleges that from at least 2015 through the present,
the defendants have participated in a debt-collection operation that has used deceptive,
harassing, and improper methods to induce consumers to make payments to them in
violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and the Consumer Financial
Protection Act (CFPA).

""This lawsuit should send a clear message to debt collectors who violate the law that we will
take action to stop such practices and protect consumers,"" said Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau Director Kathleen L. Kraninger. ""The Bureau is committed to holding
these companies and individuals accountable for threatening, harassing, and deceiving
consumers. | thank Attorney General James and her staff for working with us on this matter.""

""We will not sit idly by as debt collectors extort payment from consumers by using illegal,
deceitful tactics,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. ""Collecting on money that
consumers do not oweâand doing so using false threats of arrest and other unscrupulous
means-âis inexcusable and unlawful. My office is committed to defending the rights of New
Yorkers, and | thank the CFPB for their partnership in this case.""

The complaint, which the Bureau and NYAG filed in the federal district court for the Western
District of New York, alleges that defendants violated several provisions of the FDCPA by
threatening consumers with arrest or legal action the firms had no intention of taking or
could not legally take; threatening to contact consumersâ employers to disclose the debt;
claiming consumers owed more debt than they did in order to convince them to pay the
amount they owed; impermissibly contacting consumersâ friends, family, and workplace to
disclose the existence of a consumer's debt or to shame or humiliate them; harassing
consumers by using intimidating, belittling, or menacing language and repeatedly and
excessively phoning consumers; and failing to provide legally required notices informing
consumers of their right to know how much they owed and of their ability to dispute the
amount or existence of the purported debt.

The complaint further alleges that defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA by misrepresenting that they would have the consumer arrested, that
they would file lawsuits they did not intend to file, that they would garnish the wages of the
consumer, and that the consumer owed more than they actually did. The complaint also
alleges that the violations of the FDCPA constituted violations of the CFPA and that the
individual defendants substantially assisted the firms in their deceptive conduct.

The NYAG additionally alleges violations of New York law based on the same conduct.

The complaint seeks consumer redress, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, civil money
penalties, and appropriate injunctive relief against the defendants.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Santander Consumer USA Inc.
for Credit Reporting Violations in Connection with Its Auto Loans

DEC 22, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Santander Consumer USA Inc. (Santander) to address the Bureau's
finding that it violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The consent order was issued in
connection with Santander providing erroneous consumer loan data to consumer reporting
agencies (CRAs). Santander, a subsidiary of Banco Santander S.A., is a leading originator
and servicer of nonprime auto loans and leases. Santander furnishes credit information on
the auto loans it services by sending monthly data files to CRAs. The Bureau found that the
consumer loan data Santander furnished to CRAs between January 2016 and August 2019
contained many systemic errors that in many instances, could have negatively impacted
consumersâ credit scores and access to credit. The consent order requires Santander to take
certain steps to prevent future violations and imposes a $4,750,000 civil money penalty.

The Bureau found that Santander furnished consumer loan information to CRAs that it knew
or reasonably should have known was inaccurate, including failing to furnish accurate
information regarding whether accounts were open or closed and whether consumers were
carrying a balance or obligated to make future payments. The Bureau found that Santander
failed to promptly update and correct information it furnished to CRAs that it later
determined was incomplete and failed to provide the date of first delinquency on certain
delinquent or charged-off accounts. The Bureau further found that Santander failed to
establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the
accuracy and integrity of information provided to CRAs. Santanderâs conduct violated the
FCRA and its implementing regulation, Regulation V. Further, these violations of the FCRA
and Regulation V constituted violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010.

Under the terms of the consent order, Santander must correct all inaccuracies and errors
that the Bureau identified and take certain steps to improve and ensure the accuracy of the
consumer information it provides to CRAs. These steps include conducting monthly reviews
of account information to assess the accuracy and integrity of information Santander
furnishes. Santander must also establish and implement reasonable policies and

procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information it furnishes to CRAs.

The consent order is available at:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with LendUp Loans, LLC for Military
Lending Act Violations

JAN 19, 2021

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
proposed settlement to resolve its December 4, 2020 lawsuit against LendUp Loans, LLC
(LendUp) alleging violations of the Military Lending Act (MLA). Today's action is the first
resolution in the Bureau's broader sweep of investigations of multiple lenders that may be
violating the MLA. LendUp, which has its principal place of business in Oakland, California,
is an online lender that offers single-payment and installment loans to consumers. If entered
by the court, the proposed settlement would require LendUp to provide $300,000 in
redress to consumers and to pay a $950,000 civil money penalty. The settlement would also
enjoin LendUp from committing future violations of the MLA and from collecting on, selling,
or assigning any debts arising from loans that failed to comply with the MLA. It would also
require LendUp to correct or update the information it provided to consumer reporting
agencies about affected consumers.

The MLA puts in place protections in connection with extensions of consumer credit for
active-duty servicemembers and their dependents, who are defined as âcovered
borrowers.â These protections include a maximum allowable annual percentage rate of
36%, known as a Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR), a prohibition against required
arbitration, and certain mandatory loan disclosures. The Bureau's complaint, filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleged that since October
2016, LendUp made over 4,000 single-payment or installment loans to over 1,200 covered
borrowers in violation of the MLA. The Bureau specifically alleged that LendUpâs violations
of the MLA included extending loans with a MAPR that exceeds the MLAâs 36% cap,
extending loans that require borrowers to submit to arbitration, and failing to make certain
required loan disclosures, including a statement of the applicable MAPR.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Remittance Transfer Provider
for Remittance Transfer Rule Violations

DEC 21, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today

announced a settlement with Envios de Valores La Nacional (La Nacional) based on the
Bureauâs finding that La Nacional violated the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the
Remittance Transfer Rule, which implements EFTA. La Nacional is a large remittance transfer
provider incorporated in New York and licensed in 15 states and the District of Columbia. La
Nacional sent $2.2 billion in remittance transfers between November 2016 and April 2018
from the United States to recipients in several countries in Central America, South America,
the Caribbean, and Africa. Remittance transfers allow consumers to send money abroad,
including to family members and friends. The order requires La Nacional to pay a $750,000
civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations. This is the fourth
action stemming from a Bureau sweep to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.

The Bureau found that, since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, La
Nacional has engaged in thousands of violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.
Specifically, the Bureau's investigation found that La Nacional violated EFTA and the
Remittance Transfer Rule by failing to honor cancellation requests and failing to refund
certain fees and taxes when funds were not available on time. The Bureau also found that La
Nacional has failed to maintain appropriate error resolution policies and procedures, to
adhere to error resolution requirements, and to provide consumers with reports of
investigation findings. The Bureau further found that La Nacional has failed to treat
international bill pay services as remittance transfers and to make proper disclosures in
numerous instances.

Under the terms of the consent order, in addition to paying a penalty, La Nacional must
adopt a compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply
with all applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Settlement With Washington
Federal Bank, N.A. For Flawed Mortgage-Loan Data Reporting

OCT 27, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Washington Federal Bank, N.A., a federally insured national bank, to address the
Bureauâs finding that it reported inaccurate Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data
about its mortgage transactions for 2016 and 2017. Inaccurate HMDA data can make it
difficult for the public and regulators to discover and stop discrimination in home mortgage
lending or for public officials and lenders to tell whether a community's credit needs are
being met. The settlement requires Washington Federal to pay a $200,000 civil money
penalty and develop and implement an effective compliance-management system to
prevent future violations.

The Bureau found that Washington Federal, headquartered in Seattle, Washington, violated
HMDA, its implementing regulation, Regulation C, and the Consumer Financial Protection
Act of 2010 (CFPA) by failing to report accurate data about its mortgage-loan applications
to the Bureau. Washington Federal is currently subject to a 2013 consent order with the
Bureau based on the Bureau's previous findings that Washington Federal violated HMDA
and Regulation C.

Washington Federal reported HMDA data for over 7,000 mortgage applications in each of
2016 and 2017. The Bureau found that these data included significant errors, with some
samples having error rates as high as 40%. The Bureau found that the errors in Washington
Federalâs 2016 HMDA data were caused by a lack of appropriate staff, insufficient staff
training, and ineffective quality control, and that the errors in its 2017 HMDA data were
directly related to weaknesses in Washington Federalâs compliance-management system.
Weaknesses were specifically found in the areas of board and management oversight,
monitoring, and policies and procedures. These significant errors in reported mortgage-
application data violated Regulation C and HMDA. These violations also constituted
violations of the CFPA.

",--ERROR--,"oct 27, 2020","consumer financial protection bureau announces settlement with washington federal bank, n.a. for flawed mortgage-loan data reporting.","washington, d.c. - today, the consumer financial protection bureau (bureau) settled with washington federal bank, n.a., a federally insured national bank, to address the bureau's finding that it reported inaccurate home mortgage disclosure act (hmda) data about its mortgage transactions for 2016 and 2017. inaccurate hmda data can make it difficult for the public and regulators to discover and stop discrimination in home mortgage lending or for public officials and lenders to tell whether a community's credit needs are being met. the settlement requires washington federal to pay a $200,000 civil money penalty and develop and implement an effective compliance-management system to prevent future violations.
 the bureau found that washington federal, headquartered in seattle, washington, violated hmda, its implementing regulation, regulation c, and the consumer financial protection act of 2010 (cfpa) by failing to report accurate data about its mortgage-loan applications to the bureau. washington federal is currently subject to a 2013 consent order with the bureau based on the bureau's previous findings that washington federal violated hmda and regulation c.
 washington federal reported hmda data for over 7,000 mortgage applications in each of 2016 and 2017. the bureau found that these data included significant errors, with some samples having error rates as high as 40%. the bureau found that the errors in washington federal's 2016 hmda data were caused by a lack of appropriate staff, insufficient staff training, and ineffective quality control, and that the errors in its 2017 hmda data were directly related to weaknesses in washington federal's compliance-management system.
 weaknesses were specifically found in the areas of board and management oversight, monitoring, and policies and procedures. these significant errors in reported mortgage- application data violated regulation c and hmda. these violations also constituted violations of the cfpa.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Contract for Deed Companies
for Engaging in Deceptive Acts and Practices and Violating Credit Reporting
Rules

JUN 23, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Harbour Portfolio Advisors, LLC (Harbour); National Asset Advisors, LLC (NAA); and
National Asset Mortgage, LLC (NAM), companies that worked together to issue contracts for
deeds to consumers. Under the terms of the contracts, consumers repaid a fixed principal
over a term of years with interest. Harbourâs business plan was to acquire foreclosed
properties in bulk, at auction, from entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and resell
them to individual consumers. Harbour targeted potential buyers who were for the most
part unable to obtain conventional financing and offered them financing through contracts
for deed. Between 2012 and 2016, several thousand consumers initiated contracts for

deeds with Harbour. NAA and NAM, as Harbourâs agents, then serviced the contracts by
collecting payments, fielding disputes from consumers, and speaking with consumers about
the contractsâ terms. Harbour is a Texas limited-liability company. NAA and NAM are South
Carolina limited-liability companies; NAA dissolved in 2018 . As Harbourâs agent, NAM
furnishes consumer credit information to credit-reporting agencies.

The Bureauâs investigation found that between 2012 and 2016, when consumers called
NAA or NAM to complain about errors on their consumer reports relating to their financing
with Harbour, they were sometimes told that they had to file a dispute with the consumer-
reporting agency. These representations were inaccurate and constituted deceptive acts
and practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act. Regulation V, which
implements the Fair Credit Reporting Act, required NAA or NAM to investigate written
disputes and contact the consumer-reporting agency to resolve any errors. Also, either
company could investigate a consumer-reporting complaint based solely on a consumer's
phone call, and if they discovered an error, could fix the error by contacting the consumer-
reporting agency. The Bureau also found that NAM lacked adequate policies and
procedures to protect the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer-
reporting agencies, in violation of Regulation V.

Under the settlement, Harbour will pay a $25,000 civil money penalty to the Bureau, and
NAA and NAM will jointly pay a $10,000 civil money penalty to the Bureau. The companies
also agreed not to misrepresent or assist others in misrepresenting, expressly or impliedly,
how consumers can resolve errors in their consumer reports or any other material fact
concerning their consumer reports. NAM agreed to establish and implement reasonable
written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of information that it
furnishes to consumer-reporting agencies, and a plan to review such policies and
procedures periodically to update them as necessary to ensure their continued
effectiveness.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Commonwealth of Massachusetts File
Suit Against Credit-Repair Telemarketers

MAY 22, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) and
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey today jointly filed a
lawsuit against Commonwealth Equity Group, LLC, which does business as Key Credit
Repair, and Nikitas Tsoukales (also known as Nikitas Tsoukalis), Key Credit Repairâs
president and owner. As alleged in the complaint, from 2016 through 2019 alone, Key
Credit Repair enrolled nearly 40,000 consumers nationwide, and since 2011, it collected at
least $23 million in fees from consumers. The Bureau alleges that in their telemarketing of
credit-repair services, the defendants violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act's
(CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices and the Telemarketing Sales Ruleâs
(TSR) prohibitions on deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices.

The Bureau and Massachusettsâs complaint, filed in the federal district court for the District
of Massachusetts, specifically alleges that the defendants deceptively misrepresent that Key
Credit Repairâs actions will or likely will result in a substantial increase to consumersâ credit
scores and the removal of material negative entries on consumersâ credit reports when, in
fact, in numerous instances, Key Credit Repair did not achieve those results. The Bureau
alleges that those misrepresentations are deceptive acts or practices in violation of the
CFPA and the TSR. The Bureau further alleges that Key Credit Repair and Tsoukales
engaged in abusive acts or practices in violation of the TSR by requesting and receiving
payment for their credit-repair services before achieving the promised results and before
giving consumers a consumer report more than six months after achieving the results to
demonstrate the results. The Bureau further alleges that the alleged violations of the TSR
also constitute violations of the CFPA.

The complaint seeks redress to consumers, an injunction, and the imposition of civil money
penalties.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.
The Bureauâs investigation was conducted in partnership with Massachusetts.

A copy of the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts is available here:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Mortgage Servicer for Illegal
Practices that Impeded Borrowersâ Attempts to Avoid Foreclosure

DEC 18, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Seterus, Inc. (Seterus) and Kyanite Services, Inc. (Kyanite), as Seterusâs
successor in interest, based on the Bureauâs finding that Seterus violated the Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) and Regulation X. The Bureau found that Seterusâs
actions resulted in delaying or depriving some borrowers of a reasonable opportunity to
get their loss mitigation applications completed and evaluated and in some borrowers
failing to timely receive protections against prohibited foreclosure activities to which they
were legally entitled.

The consent order addresses widespread failures in Seterusâs handling and processing of
struggling homeownersâ applications for loss mitigation options, which are alternatives to
foreclosure made available through their servicer. The consent order requires Kyanite, as
Seterusâs successor in interest, to pay consumer redress and a civil money penalty. The
consent order requires Kyanite to pay $4,932,525 in total redress to approximately 11,866
of the consumers to whom Seterus sent a defective acknowledgment notice. The consent
order also imposes a $500,000 civil money penalty and includes injunctive relief that would
apply in the event Kyanite engages in mortgage servicing.

As a mortgage servicer, Seterus was responsible for collecting borrower applications for
these programs, communicating with borrowers regarding their applications, determining
eligibility, and implementing loss mitigation programs for qualified borrowers. At its height,
Seterus, a former mortgage servicer based in North Carolina, serviced approximately
500,000 residential mortgage loans. Seterus is no longer operating. On Feb. 28, 2019, after
the relevant period covered by the Bureauâs investigation, Seterus was sold and its entire
mortgage servicing portfolio was transferred to Nationstar Mortgage LLC, doing business as
Mr. Cooper.

The Bureau found that Seterus, which used automated processes for handling loss
mitigation applications, committed unfair acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by
systematically failing to accurately review, process, track, and communicate to borrowers
information regarding their applications. The Bureau found that Seterus also engaged in
deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by sending numerous borrowers
acknowledgment notices regarding their applications that misrepresented the status of
borrower documents and provided inaccurate due dates for submission of borrower
documents.

The Bureau found that Seterus violated Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act, by sending numerous acknowledgment notices that failed to
state the additional documents and information borrowers needed to submit to complete
their loss mitigation applications or failed to provide a reasonable due date for submission
of borrower documents. The Bureau also found that Seterus violated Regulation X by not
exercising reasonable diligence in obtaining documents and information necessary to
complete borrowersâ loss mitigation applications and by failing to properly evaluate
borrowers who submitted complete loss mitigation applications for all loss mitigation
options available to the borrower. The Bureau further found that Seterus failed to treat
certain applications as âfacially completeâ when required under Regulation X. These
violations also constitute violations of the CFPA.

Seterus sent out thousands of defective acknowledgment notices between 2014 and 2018.
As a result of Seterusâs violations, some borrowers were delayed or deprived of a
reasonable opportunity to get their loss mitigation applications completed and evaluated,
and were delayed in receiving or deprived of the protections against prohibited foreclosure
activities to which they were entitled under Regulation X. Some borrowers suffered
improper foreclosure activity as a result. Borrowers also incurred injuries such as negative
credit reporting, additional late fees, and additional interest as a result of defective
acknowledgment notices that delayed or impaired their ability to obtain the benefits of a
loss mitigation option.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Eighth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 14, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against ClearPath Lending, Inc. (ClearPath), a California corporation that is
licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 22 states. ClearPath offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
ClearPathâs principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that ClearPath sent consumers mailers for VA-guaranteed mortgages that
contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked required disclosures,
in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive
acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and
Regulation Z. The consent order requires ClearPath to pay a civil money penalty and
imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Today's action is the eighth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially
unlawful advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of
investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the
financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that ClearPath disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, ClearPath advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the annual percentage rate applicable to the
advertised mortgage. ClearPath also misleadingly advertised rates or payments as fixed,
even though the advertised mortgage was an adjustable-rate mortgage or the payment was
not fixed for the indicated duration. ClearPath also misrepresented the existence, nature, or
amount of cash or credit available to the consumer, and the existence or amount of fees or
costs to the consumer, in connection with the advertised mortgage. The Bureau also found
that ClearPath advertisements created the false impression that ClearPath was affiliated with
the VA. ClearPath advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by
Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the number and time period
of payments associated with the consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the
loan. Finally, the Bureau found that ClearPath advertisements used the name of the
consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing ClearPathâs name and
the fact that it was not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the consumer's current lender,
as required by Regulation Z.

The consent order against ClearPath requires ClearPath to pay a civil penalty of $625,000.
The consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including
requiring ClearPath to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising
compliance official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with
mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those
identified by the Bureau; and requiring ClearPath to comply with certain enhanced
disclosure requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

consent order against PHLoans.com, Inc. (PHLoans), a California corporation that is licensed
as a mortgage broker or lender in about 11 states. Until at least April 2019, PHLoans was
known as Pacific Home Loans, Inc. PHLoans offers and provides mortgage loans guaranteed
by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). PHLoansâs principal means of
advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to
United States military servicemembers and veterans. The Bureau found that PHLoans sent
consumers numerous mailers for VA-guaranteed mortgages that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked required disclosures, in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and
practices, the Mortgage Acts and PracticesâAdvertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z.
The consent order requires PHLoans to pay a civil money penalty and imposes
requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the fourth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of
multiple mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed
mortgages. On July 24, 2020, the Bureau announced consent orders against Sovereign
Lending Group, Inc., and Prime Choice Funding, Inc., and on August 21, 2020, the Bureau
announced a consent order against Go Direct Lenders, Inc., for similar violations. The
Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising
provides consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and
terms available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This
ongoing sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws
that ensure the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including
servicemembers, veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are
designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that PHLoans disseminated advertisements that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures. For
example, PHLoans advertisements misrepresented the credit terms of the advertised
mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually prepared to offer
to the consumer, including misrepresenting the payment amount applicable to the
advertised mortgage and the nature or amount of cash available to the consumer in
connection with the advertised mortgage. PHLoans also made misrepresentations about the
existence and amount of fees or costs to the consumer in connection with the advertised
mortgage. The Bureau also found that PHLoans advertisements failed to properly disclose,
when required by Regulation Z, credit terms for the advertised mortgage, such as the
consumer's repayment obligations over the full term of the loan.

The consent order against PHLoans requires PHLoans to pay a civil penalty of $260,000. The
consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring
PHLoans to bolster its compliance functions by designating an advertising compliance
official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage
advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting misrepresentations similar to those identified
by the Bureau; and requiring PHLoans to comply with certain enhanced disclosure
requirements to prevent future misrepresentations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Takes Action Against Debt-Relief Business
and Its Owner for Taking Illegal Advance Fees

NOV 05, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today filed a
complaint against Performance SLC, LLC (PSLC), a California debt-relief business focused
on federal student loan debt; Performance Settlement, LLC (PSettlement), a California debt-
settlement company; and Daniel Crenshaw, the owner and CEO of the two companies. The
Bureau alleges that PSLC and Crenshaw charged illegal advance fees in violation of the
Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR) to student loan borrowers seeking to obtain loan
consolidation, loan forgiveness, or income-driven repayment plans for their federal student
loans, and that PSLC failed to make required disclosures to certain consumers in violation of
the TSR. The Bureau also alleges that PSettlement and Crenshaw used deceptive tactics in
violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) in order to induce consumers to
sign up for PSettlement's services.

The Bureau's complaint, which was filed in federal district court for the Central District of
California, alleges that from 2015 through the present, PSLC charged consumers illegal
upfront fees by using telemarketing campaigns to convince thousands of consumers to sign
up for services to assist them in obtaining loan consolidation, loan forgiveness, or income-
driven repayment plans from the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Consumers would pay
between $1,000 and $1,450 in fees to PSLC for it to file paperwork with ED, even though
student loan borrowers can do this themselves for free. Under the TSR, it is illegal to request
or receive any fees for debt-relief services sold through telemarketing before the terms of
the debt are altered or settled, and the consumer has made at least one payment under the
newly altered debt. The Bureau alleges that the PSLC and Crenshaw violated the TSR
because consumers were charged at or just after enrollment, before the terms of the debts
were altered. The Bureau also alleges that PSLC had some consumers pay this prohibited
upfront fee through high-interest financing from a third party. Some consumers paid a
portion or all of their fee into a trust account, but the complaint alleges that PSLC failed to
provide them with disclosures required by the TSR.

The complaint also alleges that PSettlement and Crenshaw, from as early as 2019, engaged
in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by representing to consumers that
PSettlement, a debt-settlement company that does not make loans, had considered and
rejected those consumers for personal loans to induce them to sign up for PSettlementâs
debt-relief services. Finally, the Bureau alleges that Crenshaw substantially assisted PSLC in
requesting or receiving fees illegally and PSettlement in engaging in deceptive acts and
practices.

The complaint seeks redress to consumers, injunctive relief, and the imposition of civil
money penalties against the defendants.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

The Bureauâs complaint is available at:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Auto Lender for Unfair Loss
Damage Waiver Practices

SEP 21, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. -â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) settled
with Lobel Financial Corporation, an auto-loan servicer based in Anaheim, California. The
Bureau found that Lobel engaged in unfair practices with respect to its Loss Damage Waiver
(LDW) product, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). When a
borrower has insufficient insurance, rather than force-placing collateral-protection
insurance, Lobel places the LDW product, which is not itself insurance, on borrower
accounts and charges a monthly premium of approximately $70 for the LDW coverage. The
LDW product provides that Lobel will pay for the cost of covered repairs and, in the event of
a total vehicle loss, cancel the borrower's debt. The Bureau found that Lobel continued to
bill certain consumers for LDW coverage but then failed to provide it, and assessed fees
from consumers that they were not obligated to pay. The order requires Lobel to pay
$1,345,224 in consumer redress to approximately 4,000 harmed consumers and a $100,000
civil money penalty. The order also prohibits Lobel from failing to provide consumers with
LDW coverage or similar products or services for which it has charged consumers or from
charging consumers fees that are not authorized by its LDW contracts.

Lobel's LDW agreement, which all Lobel borrowers must sign, specifies that if at any time
the borrower fails to maintain car insurance subject to certain specifications, Lobel will add
LDW coverage to the consumer's account and impose a monthly charge. If a borrower
becomes ten or more days delinquent on an auto loan with LDW coverage, Lobel may stop
the LDW coverage. The Bureau's investigation found that, since 2012, Lobel charged
customers LDW premiums after they had become ten-days delinquent on their auto loans
but did not provide them with LDW coverage. When these customers needed repairs or
experienced total vehicle losses, Lobel denied their claims. This practice was unfair under
the CFPA because consumers were charged for a service that they did not receive.

The Bureau also found that Lobel charged some customers LDW-related fees that Lobel
had not disclosed in its LDW contract. This practice was also unfair under the CFPA.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Settlement with TD Bank for
Illegal Overdraft Practices

AUG 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) today
announced a settlement with TD Bank, N.A. regarding its marketing and sale of its optional
overdraft service: Debit Card Advance (DCA). TD Bank is headquartered in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, and operates about 1,250 locations throughout much of the eastern part of the
country. The Bureau found that TD Bank's overdraft enrollment practices violated the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and Regulation E by charging consumers overdraft fees
for ATM and one-time debit card transactions without obtaining their affirmative consent,
and that TD Bank engaged in deceptive and abusive acts or practices in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). The Bureau also found that TD Bank
engaged in practices prohibited by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and its
implementing Regulation V. Todayâs consent order requires TD Bank to provide an
estimated $97 million in restitution to about 1.42 million consumers and to pay a civil
money penalty of $25 million.

The Bureau specifically found that TD Bank charged consumers overdraft fees for ATM and
one-time debit card transactions without obtaining their affirmative consent in violation of
EFTA and Regulation E, both after new customers opened checking accounts at TD Bank
branches and after new customers opened checking accounts at events held outside of
Bank branches.

The Bureau further found that when presenting DCA to new customers, TD Bank
deceptively claimed DCA was a âfreeâ service or benefit or that it was a âfeatureâ or
âpackageâ that âcomes withâ new consumer-checking accounts. In fact, TD Bank charges
customers $35 for each overdraft transaction paid through DCA and DCA is an optional
service that does not come with a consumer-checking account. When TD Bank enrolled
some consumers in DCA over the phone, TD Bank deceptively described DCA as covering
transactions unlikely to be covered by DCA. In some instances, TD Bank engaged in abusive
acts or practices by materially interfering with consumersâ ability to understand DCAâs terms
and conditions. In some cases, TD Bank: required new customers to sign its overdraft notice
with the âenrolledâ option pre-checked without mentioning the DCA service to the
consumer at all; enrolled new customers in DCA without requesting the customer's oral
enrollment decision; and deliberately obscured, or attempted to obscure, the overdraft
notice to prevent a new customer's review of their pre-marked âenrolledâ status in DCA.

The Bureau also found that TD Bank violated FCRA and Regulation V by failing to establish
and implement reasonable written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and
integrity of consumer-account information it furnished to two nationwide specialty
consumer reporting agencies. The Bureau also found that TD Bank failed to conduct timely
investigations of indirect consumer disputes concerning its furnishing to one of those
specialty agencies.

To provide relief for consumers affected by TD Bank's unlawful overdraft enrollment
practices, the Bureauâs consent order requires TD Bank to provide an estimated $97 million
in restitution to about 1.42 million consumers. TD Bank must also pay a civil money penalty
of $25 million. The consent order also requires TD Bank to correct its DCA enrollment
practices, stop using pre-marked overdraft notices to obtain a consumer's affirmative
consent to enroll in DCA, and adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that TD
Bank's furnishing practices concerning nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies
comply with all applicable Federal consumer financial laws.

The consent order is available at: https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_td-

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Announces Action Against Citizens Bank,
N.A.

JAN 30, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed suit
against Citizens Bank, N.A. (Citizens), a national banking association headquartered in
Providence, Rhode Island. The Bureau's complaint alleges violations of the Truth in Lending
Act (TILA) and TILAâs implementing Regulation Z, including violations of amendments to
TILA contained in the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) and the Credit Card Accountability
Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act).

As described in the complaint, the Bureau alleges that for several years Citizens violated
TILA, as amended by the FCBA, and Regulation Z by failing to properly manage and
respond to credit card disputes. The complaint alleges that Citizens automatically denied
consumersâ billing error notices and claims of unauthorized use in certain circumstances.
The complaint further alleges that Citizens failed to fully refund finance charges and fees
when consumers asserted meritorious disputes or fraud claims, and failed to send
consumers required acknowledgement letters and denial notices in response to billing
error notices.

The Bureau further alleges that for several years Citizens violated TILA by violating
provisions passed under the CARD Act. The Bureau alleges that Citizens violated TILA and
Regulation Z by failing to provide credit counseling referrals to consumers who called
Citizensâ toll-free number designated for that purpose. These alleged violations of TILAâ
including those under the FCBA and the CARD Actâand Regulation Z also constitute
violations of the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

The Bureau filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island on
January 30, 2020. The Bureau's complaint seeks, among other remedies, an injunction
against defendants and the imposition of civil money penalties.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Sues Debt Settlement Company FDATR,
Inc., and Owners Dean Tucci and Kenneth Wayne Halverson

NOV 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) filed a
lawsuit against FDATR, Inc., and its owners, Dean Tucci and Kenneth Wayne Halverson. The
Bureau alleges that FDATR, Tucci, and Halverson violated the Telemarketing Sales Rule
(TSR) by engaging in deceptive and abusive telemarketing acts or practices and the
Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) through deceptive acts or practices.
FDATR was a corporation headquartered in Wood Dale, Illinois, that promised to provide
student-loan debt-relief and credit-repair services to consumers nationwide. Tucci and
Halverson both owned and managed FDATR, which was involuntarily dissolved in
September 2020. The Bureau's complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, seeks injunctions against FDATR, Tucci, and Halverson, as well as
damages, redress to consumers, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, and the imposition of
civil money penalties.

The Bureau specifically alleges that from 2011 through at least April 2019, the defendants
engaged in abusive telemarketing by requesting and taking payments from consumers for
debt-relief and credit-repair services before achieving the results it promised and before it
was legally allowed to do so under the TSR. The Bureau also alleges that during this same
period, the defendants used deception in violation of the TSR and CFPA to attract
consumers by misrepresenting material aspects of its student-loan debt-relief services. For
example, the defendants falsely represented that its services would reduce or eliminate
student-loan payments and improve credit scores. The Bureau further alleges that
defendantsâ violations of the TSR constituted violations of the CFPA. In addition, the Bureau
alleges that Tucci and Halverson are individually liable under the TSR and CFPA because
they knew of, directed, and engaged in the violations described in the complaint and
substantially assisted FDATR.

The complaint is not a finding or ruling that the defendants have violated the law.

A copy of the complaint filed in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois is

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Student Loan Servicers
Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation, and Discover Products, Inc. for
Violating a Bureau Consent Order and Other Unlawful Practices

DEC 22, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation, and Discover
Products, Inc. (collectively, Discover) based on the Bureau's findings that Discover violated a
prior Bureau order, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the Consumer Financial
Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA). Discover Bank, headquartered in Greenwood, Delaware, is
an insured depository institution that provides and services private student loans. The
Student Loan Corporation and Discover Products, Inc., are affiliates of Discover Bank, and
also engage in student loan servicing. Under todayâs order, Discover must pay at least $10
million in consumer redress and a $25 million civil money penalty.

The Bureau previously issued a consent order against Discover in July 2015 (2015 Order).
The Bureau's 2015 Order was based on the Bureau's finding that Discover misstated the
minimum amounts due on billing statements as well as tax information consumers needed
to get federal income tax benefits. The Bureau also found that Discover engaged in illegal
debt collection practices. The Bureauâs 2015 Order required Discover to refund $16 million
to consumers, pay a penalty, and fix its unlawful practices servicing and collection practices.
The Bureau found that Discover violated the 2015 Order's requirements in several ways.
Discover misrepresented the minimum loan payments consumers owed, the amount of
interest consumers paid, and other material information, such as interest rates, payments,
due dates, and the availability of rewards, among other things. Discover also did not
provide all of the consumer redress the 2015 Order required.

The Bureau found that Discover engaged in unfair acts and practices by withdrawing
payments from more than 17,000 consumersâ accounts without valid authorization and by
cancelling or not withdrawing payments for more than 14,000 consumers without notifying
them. This conduct violated the CFPA, EFTA, and Regulation E. The Bureau also found that
Discover engaged in deceptive acts and practices in violation of the CFPA by
misrepresenting to more than 100,000 consumers the minimum payment owed and to
more than 8,000 consumers the amount of interest paid. Some consumers ended up paying
more than they owed, others became late or delinquent because they could not pay the
overstated amount, while others may have filed inaccurate tax returns.

Todayâs order prohibits Discover from making any misrepresentations about minimum
payments consumers owe, the amount of interest consumers paid, and other material
servicing terms. The order also prohibits Discover from withdrawing loan payments from
consumersâ bank accounts in amounts or at times not authorized by consumers.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Sixth Mortgage Company to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

SEP 01, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against Service 1st Mortgage, Inc. (Service 1st), a mortgage broker based in
Glen Burnie, Maryland that is licensed in about 12 states. Service 1st offers and provides
mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Service 1st's principal means of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail
advertisements sent primarily to United States military servicemembers and veterans. The
Bureau found that in advertising VA-guaranteed mortgages Service 1st sent consumers
numerous mailers that contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that lacked
required disclosures, in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Actâs (CFPA)
prohibition against deceptive acts and practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practicesâ
Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z. The consent order requires Service 1st to
pay a civil money penalty and imposes requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs action is the sixth case stemming from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple
mortgage companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages.
The Bureau commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful
advertising in the market that the VA identified. This ongoing sweep of investigations
reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure the financial

marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers, veterans, and
surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that, since December 2015, Service 1st disseminated advertisements that
contained false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required
disclosures. For example, Service 1st advertised specific credit terms, such as APRs and
hypothetical payment amounts that it was not prepared to offer, or that it could only offer
for an introductory period but advertised as if they were permanent loan terms. Service 1st
also used terms in millions of its advertisements that falsely represented or implied that
Service 1st was affiliated with the government, including the VA, that the advertised product
was endorsed, sponsored by, or affiliated with the United States government, or that the
United States government was the source of the advertisements. In addition, in
advertisements mailed between April 2016 and May 2017, Service 1st stated that it would
pay an estimated escrow refund of a specific amount if the consumer refinanced through
Service 1st, even though the advertised escrow refund amount was calculated using a
method that would not yield an actual estimate for that consumer, and in cash-out
transactions the ârefundâ was actually added to the principal of the consumer's loan.

Service 1st also sent advertisements between December 2015 and April 2017 representing
that a consumer could â[s]kip two paymentsâ or âmissâ two payments by refinancing with the
company, but it did not disclose the limitations on this option, or that the skipped or missed
payments would be added to the principal balance of the consumer's loan. Its
advertisements also stated: âthe Economic Stimulus Program will end soon. There is
currently no plan to extend the Stimulus Program,â which was untrue. Finally, many Service
1st advertisements included claims or terms that require additional disclosures, but Service
1st failed to make these disclosures.

The consent order against Service 1st requires it to pay a civil penalty of $230,000. The
consent order also imposes injunctive relief to prevent future violations, including requiring
Service 1st to bolster its compliance functions by: (1) designating an advertising compliance
official who must review its mortgage advertisements for compliance with mortgage
advertising laws prior to the dissemination of the advertisements; (2) prohibiting
misrepresentations similar to those the Bureau found it has made; and (3) requiring it to
comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent future
misrepresentations.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Remittance Transfer Providers
for Remittance Transfer Rule Violations

AUG 31, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) entered
into settlements with Trans-Fast Remittance LLC and Sigue Corporation and its subsidiaries,
SGS Corporation and GroupEx Corporation. Trans-Fast, which until recently was a
remittance transfer provider, is based in New York, New York and licensed in over 30 states.
Sigue and its subsidiaries, which are all headquartered in Sylmar, California, provide
consumers with international money-transfer services, including remittance-transfer
services. The Bureau found that Trans-Fast and Sigue and its subsidiaries violated the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) and the Remittance Transfer Rule, which implements
EFTA. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act
of 2010's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. The consent orders require
the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose requirements to prevent future
violations. Sigue and its subsidiaries must also pay consumer redress. These actions reflect a
sweep of enforcement actions to address violations of the Remittance Transfer Rule.

The Bureauâs investigation of Trans-Fast found that it violated EFTA and the Remittance
Transfer Rule by failing to adhere to error resolution requirements and properly respond to
cancellation requests, failing to provide refunds the Remittance Transfer Rule requires,
failing to maintain required policies and procedures, and failing to provide required
disclosures. Since the 2013 effective date of the Remittance Transfer Rule, Trans-Fast
provided about 40 million disclosures to consumers that violated the Remittance Transfer
Rule. The Bureau also found that Trans-Fast engaged in deceptive acts or practices in
violation of the CFPA by making misleading statements in advertisements regarding the
speed of its remittance transfers and making misleading statements in disclosures
purporting to limit consumersâ error resolution rights.

The Bureauâs investigation of Sigue and its subsidiaries found that between 2013 and 2019,
they violated EFTA and the Remittance Transfer Rule. Specifically, the Bureau found that
Sigue and its subsidiaries failed to refund transaction fees when they did not make funds
available by the disclosed date of availability, and they failed to inform consumers of the
remedies available for remittance errors. When Sigue and its subsidiaries investigated
remittance errors, they failed to report to consumers in writing the results of their
investigations into transaction errors or consumersâ rights as required by the Rule. Sigue
and its subsidiaries also failed to develop and maintain adequate written policies and
procedures designed to ensure compliance with certain Remittance Transfer Rule error-
resolution requirements and failed to comply with several Remittance Transfer Rule
disclosure requirements.

The consent order against Trans-Fast requires it to pay a $1.6 million civil money penalty. If
Trans-Fast resumes offering remittance transfers, the consent order requires it to adopt a
compliance plan to ensure that its remittance transfer acts and practices comply with all
applicable Federal consumer financial laws and the consent order.

The consent order against Sigue and its subsidiaries requires them to pay about $100,000
in consumer redress and a $300,000 civil money penalty. They must also implement and
maintain written policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the
Remittance Transfer Rule and maintain a compliance-management system that is designed
to ensure that their operations comply with the Remittance Transfer Rule, including
conducting training and oversight of all agents, employees, and service providers, and not
violating the Remittance Transfer Rule in the future.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc.
and Its Owner, Robert M. Steenbergh, for Deceptive Sales Practices

NOV 20, 2020

WASHINGTON, D.C. â Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued a
consent order against U.S. Equity Advantage, Inc. (âUSEAâ) and its owner, Robert M.
Steenbergh. The Bureau found that the companyâs disclosures and advertisements of its
auto loan payment program contained misleading statements in violation of the Consumer
Financial Protection Act of 2010's prohibition against deceptive acts or practices. Robert M.
Steenbergh is the founder, sole-owner, and chief executive officer of USEA, a nonbank
located in Orlando, Florida. The consent order imposes a judgment against them requiring
them to pay $9,300,000 in consumer redress and contains requirements to prevent future
violations.

USEA and Steenbergh operate an auto loan payment program called AutoPayPlus, which
charges fees to deduct payments from consumersâ bank accounts every two weeks and then
forwards those payments every month to the consumersâ lenders. The Bureau found that
USEA and Steenbergh misrepresented the amount consumers would save when disclosing
the program's benefits by not including a $399 enrollment fee in the calculations presented
to consumers. USEA and Steenbergh created the misleading impression that consumers
would save money using its product, when in fact, because of the enrollment fee, the
programâs costs ordinarily exceeded any savings. The Bureau also found that USEA and
Steenbergh stated in advertising that they have helped hundreds of thousands of customers
save $29 million or more in interest by participating in AutoPayPlus when they had no basis
for making this claim, and when the program had, in fact, not saved consumers that amount.
The Bureau found that more than 100,000 consumers were subject to USEAâs and
Steenberghâs deceptive practices and that consumers should receive $9,300,000 in redress
for fees they paid.

The ordered redress amount is suspended upon payment of $900,000 and a $1 civil money
penalty to the Bureau. The suspension of the full payment for redress, as well as the $1 civil
penalty, is based on USEAâs and Steenberghâs demonstrated inability to pay more based on
sworn financial statements. Consumers harmed by USEA and Steenbergh may be eligible
for additional relief from the Bureau's Civil Penalty Fund. If victims cannot be located or it is
otherwise not practicable to pay victims, the Bureau will keep the money in the Fund for
victims in future cases rather than the money being sent to the Treasury.

The consent order prohibits USEA and Steenbergh from making any misrepresentations
about its payment programs. It also requires them to account for the total costs for its
payment programs, as well as the net savings or costs after deducting any fees, whenever
they make claims about savings or financial benefits.

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles with Mortgage Companies to
Address Deceptive Loan Advertisements Sent to Servicemembers and Veterans

JUL 24, 2020

Washington, D.C. - Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau) issued
consent orders against Sovereign Lending Group, Inc. (Sovereign) and Prime Choice
Funding, Inc. (Prime Choice). Sovereign is a California corporation that is licensed as a
mortgage broker or lender in about 44 states and the District of Columbia. Prime Choice is
a California corporation that is licensed as a mortgage broker or lender in about 35 states
and the District of Columbia. Both companies offer and provide mortgage loans
guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Their principal means
of advertising VA-guaranteed loans is through direct-mail advertisements sent primarily to
United States military servicemembers and veterans. The Bureau found that the companies
mailed consumers advertisements for VA-guaranteed mortgages that contained false,
misleading, and inaccurate statements or lacked required disclosures, in violation of the
Consumer Financial Protection Act's (CFPA) prohibition against deceptive acts and
practices, the Mortgage Acts and Practices - Advertising Rule (MAP Rule), and Regulation Z.
The consent orders require the companies to pay civil money penalties and impose
requirements to prevent future violations.

Todayâs actions stem from a Bureau sweep of investigations of multiple mortgage
companies that use deceptive mailers to advertise VA-guaranteed mortgages. The Bureau
commenced this sweep in response to concerns about potentially unlawful advertising in
the market that the VA identified. Accurate and legally compliant advertising provides
consumers with valuable information about the different types of mortgages and terms
available so they can effectively shop for products that best meet their needs. This ongoing
sweep of investigations reflects the Bureauâs commitment to enforcing the laws that ensure
the financial marketplace is fair and accurate for all consumers, including servicemembers,
veterans, and surviving spouses whom VA-guaranteed mortgages are designed to benefit.

The Bureau found that Sovereign and Prime disseminated advertisements that contained
false, misleading, and inaccurate statements or that failed to include required disclosures.
For example, Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements misrepresented the credit terms
of the advertised mortgage loan by stating credit terms that the company was not actually
prepared to offer to the consumer. Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements
misleadingly described an advertised introductory interest rate as a âfixedâ rate, when in fact
the rate was adjustable and could increase over time. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also created the false impression that they were affiliated with the
government by using words, phrases, images, or designs that are associated with the VA or
the Internal Revenue Service.

The Bureau also found that both Sovereign and Prime Choice advertisements used the
name of the consumer's lender in a misleading way by not adequately disclosing their own
names and the fact that they were not associated with, or acting on behalf of, the
consumer's current lender, as required by Regulation Z. Sovereign advertisements made
false claims about consumer's existing loans, and falsely implied that the consumer could
address these problems by obtaining a loan from Sovereign. Sovereign and Prime Choice
advertisements also failed to properly disclose, when required by Regulation Z, credit terms
for the advertised mortgage, such as the consumer's repayment obligations over the full
term of the loan and the period during which certain interest rates would apply. Further,
Prime Choice advertisements created the false impression that they contained a property
assessment as well as misleading comparisons between hypothetical credit terms and the
terms of the advertised product.

The consent order against Sovereign requires Sovereign to pay a civil penalty of $460,000.
The consent order against Prime Choice requires Prime Choice to pay a civil penalty of
$645,000. The consent orders also impose injunctive relief to prevent future violations,
including requiring the companies to bolster their compliance functions by designating an
advertising compliance official who must review their mortgage advertisements for
compliance with mortgage advertising laws prior to their use; prohibiting
misrepresentations similar to those identified by the Bureau; and requiring the companies
to comply with certain enhanced disclosure requirements to prevent them from making
future misrepresentations.
