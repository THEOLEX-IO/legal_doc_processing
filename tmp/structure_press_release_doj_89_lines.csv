Deutsche Bank Agrees to Pay over $130 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and
Fraud Case

Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (Deutsche Bank or the Company) has agreed to pay more than $130 million to resolve the governmentâs
investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and a separate investigation into a commodities fraud scheme.

The resolution includes criminal penalties of $85,186,206, criminal disgorgement of $681,480, victim Compensation payments of $1,223,738,
and $43,329,622 to be paid to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission in a coordinated resolution.

Deutsche Bank is a multi-national financial services company headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. The charges arise out of a scheme to
conceal corrupt payments and bribes made to third-party intermediaries by falsely recording them on Deutsche Bankâs books and records, as
well as related internal accounting control violations, and a separate scheme to engage in fraudulent and manipulative commodities trading
practices involving publicly-traded precious metals futures contracts.

Deutsche Bank entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Money
Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and with the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York. The criminal
information was filed today in the Eastern District of New York charging Deutsche Bank with one count of conspiracy to violate the books and
records and internal accounting controls provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution
in relation to the commodities conduct.

âDeutsche Bank engaged in a seven-year course of conduct, during which it failed to implement a system of internal accounting controls
regarding the use of company funds and falsified its books and records to conceal corrupt and improper payments,â said Acting Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Robert Zink of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âSeparately, Deutsche Bank traders on three continents
sought to manipulate our public financial markets through fraud for five years. This resolution exemplifies the departmentâs commitment to help
ensure that publicly traded companies devise and implement appropriate and proper systems of internal accounting controls and maintain
accurate and truthful corporate documentation. It also stands as an example of the departmentâs efforts to police the public U.S. markets so
that all may continue to trust, and rely upon, the integrity of our public financial systems.â

âDeutsche Bank engaged in a criminal scheme to conceal payments to so-called consultants worldwide who served as conduits for bribes to
foreign officials and others so that they could unfairly obtain and retain lucrative business projects,â stated Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D.
DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âThis office will continue to hold responsible financial institutions that operate in the United
States and engage in practices to facilitate criminal activity in order to increase their bottom line.â

âThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service takes pride in investigating complex fraud and corruption cases that impact American investors,â said
Inspector in Charge Delany De LÃ©on-Coldn of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group. âThis type of deceptive activity
can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world. The combined efforts of our partners at the FBI and
Department of Justice helped to bring todayâs significant action which illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international
marketplace.â

The FCPA Case

According to admissions and court documents, between 2009 and 2016, Deutsche Bank, acting through its employees and agents, including
managing directors and high-level regional executives, knowingly and willfully conspired to maintain false books, records, and accounts to
conceal, among other things, payments to a business development consultant (BDC) who was acting as a proxy for a foreign official and
payments to a BDC that were actually bribes paid to a decisionmaker for a client in order to obtain lucrative business for the bank. In some
instances, Deutsche Bank made payments to BDCs that were not supported by invoices or evidence of any services provided. In other cases,
Deutsche Bank employees created or helped BDCâs create false justifications for payments.

In relation to a Saudi BDC, Deutsche Bank admitted that its employees conspired to contract with a company owned by the wife of a client
decisionmaker to facilitate bribe payments of over $1 million to the decisionmaker. Deutsche Bank approved the BDC relationship despite
Deutsche Bank employees knowing about the relationship between the Saudi BDC and the decisionmaker, and approved the corrupt payments
despite Deutsche Bank employees openly discussing the need to pay the Saudi BDC in order to incentivize her husband to continue to do
business with Deutsche Bank. In requesting approval of one payment, Deutsche Bank employees cautioned that the âclient and [the Saudi BDC]
are intimately linked and... . any cessation of payment to the [the Saudi BDC] will certainly prompt a significant outflow of [business]â from the
client.

Deutsche Bank also contracted with an Abu Dhabi BDC to obtain a lucrative transaction, despite Deutsche Bank employees knowing that the
Abu Dhabi BDC lacked qualifications as a BDC, other than his family relationship with the client decisionmaker, and that the Abu Dhabi BDC was
in fact acting as proxy for the client decisionmaker. Deutsche Bank paid the Abu Dhabi BDC over $3 million without invoices.

By agreeing to misrepresent the purpose of payments to BDCs and falsely characterizing payments to others as payments to BDCs, Deutsche
Bank employees conspired to falsify Deutsche Bankâs books, records, and accounts, in violation of the FCPA. Additionally, Deutsche Bank
employees knowingly and willfully conspired to fail to implement internal accounting controls in violation of the FCPA by, among other things,
failing to conduct meaningful due diligence regarding BDCs, making payments to certain BDCs who were not under contract with Deutsche
Bank at the time, and making payments to certain BDCs without invoices or adequate documentation of the services purportedly performed.

Deutsche Bank will pay a total criminal penalty of $79,561,206 in relation to the FCPA scheme. In a related matter with the U.S. Securities &
Exchange Commission, Deutsche Bank will also pay $43,329,622 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.

The Commodities Fraud Case

According to admissions and court documents, between 2008 and 2013, Deutsche Bank precious metals traders engaged in a scheme to
defraud other traders on the New York Mercantile Exchange Inc. and Commodity Exchange Inc., which are commodities exchanges operated by
the CME Group Inc. On numerous occasions, traders on Deutsche Bankâs precious metals desk in New York, Singapore, and London placed
orders to buy and sell precious metals futures contracts with the intent to cancel those orders before execution, including in an attempt to profit
by deceiving other market participants through injecting false and misleading information concerning the existence of genuine supply and
demand for precious metals futures contracts.

On Sept. 25, 2020, a Chicago federal jury found two former Deutsche Bank precious metals traders, James Vorley, 42, of the United Kingdom,
and Cedric Chanu, 40, of France and the United Arab Emirates, guilty of wire fraud affecting a financial institution for their respective roles in
the commodities scheme. A third former Deutsche Bank trader, David Liew, 35, of Singapore, pleaded guilty on June 1, 2017, to conspiracy to
commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and spoofing. A fourth former Deutsche Bank trader, Edward Bases, 58, of New Canaan,
Connecticut, was charged in a third superseding indictment on Nov. 12, 2020, and awaits trial on fraud and conspiracy charges. An indictment is
merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Deutsche Bank has agreed to pay a total criminal amount of $7,530,218 in relation to the commodities scheme. This amount includes criminal
disgorgement of $681,480, victim compensation payments of $1,223,738, and a criminal penalty of $5,625,000, which will be fully credited
against Deutsche Bankâs payment of a civil monetary penalty of $30 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in January 2018
in connection with substantially the same commodities conduct.

The department reached this resolution with Deutsche Bank based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily
disclose the conduct to the department and the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included corrupt payments, willful violations of the
FCPA accounting provisions, and commodities trading violations in three countries. Deutsche Bank received full credit for its cooperation with
the department's investigations and for its significant remediation. Penalties associated with both the FCPA and wire fraud conspiracies reflect a
discount of 25 percent off the middle of the otherwise-applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range, to account for Deutsche Bankâs 2015
resolution in connection with its manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate.

The FCPA investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section and Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys
Katherine Nielsen, Elizabeth S. Boison and Nikhila Raj, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alixandra Smith and Whitman Knapp. The Justice
Departmentâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance in this case.

The commodities case is being investigated by the FBIâs New York Field Office, and is being prosecuted by the Fraud Section. Deputy Chief Brian
R. Young, Assistant Chief Avi Perry, and Trial Attorney Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

Former Russian Nuclear Energy Official Sentenced to 48 Months in Prison for Money Laundering
Conspiracy Involving Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Violations

U.S. Conspirators Paid More Than $2 Million to Influence Russian Nuclear Energy Official and to Secure Business with State-Owned Russian
Nuclear Energy Company

A former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison for conspiracy to commit money laundering in
connection with his role in arranging more than $2 million in corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with a Russian state-
owned nuclear energy corporation.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein of the District of
Maryland, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations John R. Hartman of the U.S. Department of Energyâs Office of Inspector General (DOE-
OIG) and Assistant Director in Charge Paul M. Abbate of the FBIâs Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Vadim Mikerin, 56, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, was also ordered to forfeit $2,126,622.36 by U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the
District of Maryland.

According to court documents, Mikerin was the director of the Pan American Department of JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of
Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to
nuclear power companies worldwide, and the president of TENAM Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary and the official representative of
TENEX. Court documents show that between 2004 and October 2014, conspirators agreed to make corrupt payments to influence Mikerin and
to secure improper business advantages for U.S. companies that did business with TENEX, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA). Mikerin admitted that he conspired with Daren Condrey, Boris Rubizhevsky and others to transmit approximately $2,126,622 from
Maryland and elsewhere in the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts located in Cyprus, Latvia and Switzerland with the intent
to promote the FCPA violations. Mikerin further admitted that the conspirators used consulting agreements and code words to disguise the
corrupt payments.

Condrey, 50, of Glenwood, Maryland, pleaded guilty on June 17, 2015, to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Rubizhevsky, 64, of Closter, New Jersey, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2015, to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Condrey and Rubizhevsky
await sentencing.

The DOE-OIG and FBI investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro, Ephraim Wernick and Derek Ettinger of the Criminal Division's
Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David |. Salem and Michael T. Packard and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Meghan A. Leibold of the
District of Maryland prosecuted the case.

Mozambiqueâs Former Finance Minister Indicted Alongside Other Former Mozambican Officials,
Business Executives, and Investment Bankers in Alleged $2 Billion Fraud and Money Laundering
Scheme that Victimized U.S. Investors

More Than $200 Million in Alleged Bribes and Kickbacks Paid to Mozambican Government Officials and
Investment Bankers in Corrupt Maritime Loans for Mozambique

A four-count indictment was returned on Dec. 19, 2018, by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York, charging two executives of a
shipbuilding company, three former senior Mozambican government officials, and three former London-based investment bankers for their roles
in a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme that victimized investors from the United States and elsewhere.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York, and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThe indictment unsealed today alleges a brazen international criminal scheme in which corrupt Mozambique government officials, corporate
executives, and investment bankers stole approximately $200 million in loan proceeds that were meant to benefit the people of Mozambique,â
said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are dedicated to using all tools at
our disposal to prosecute those who engage in money laundering, financial fraud and corruption at the expense of U.S. investors, wherever
those individuals may be located.â

âAs charged in the indictment, the defendants orchestrated an immense fraud and bribery scheme that took advantage of the U.S. financial
system, defrauded its investors and adversely impacted the economy of Mozambique, in order to line their own pockets with hundreds of
millions of dollars,â said U.S. Attorney Donoghue. âThis indictment underscores the Department of Justiceâs continuing efforts to end such
fraudulent and corrupt practices and to hold those responsible to account for their crimes.â

âToday's indictment proves that no matter who you are, or what position of power you're in, you're not immune from prosecution,â said FBI
Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âThe FBI will continue to use all resources at our disposal to uncover crimes of this nature and expose
them for what they really are.â

Jean Boustani, 40, a citizen of Lebanon who worked for the Privinvest Group, a United Arab Emirates-based shipbuilding company, was arrested
at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Jan. 2, 2019 and arraigned later that day in the Eastern District of New York on charges that he
conspired with others to commit one count of wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering in connection with
$200 million in bribe and kickback payments he helped organize relating to three loans totaling more than $2 billion that were marketed and
sold to U.S. victim investors. Boustani has pleaded not guilty to the charges; a trial date has not yet been set. Alongside Boustani, Privinvestâs
chief financial officer Najib Allam, 58, a citizen of Lebanon, was charged with the same counts. Allam is alleged to have worked with Boustani to
make the bribe and kickback payments. Allam is not currently in U.S. custody.

Manuel Chang, 63, the former Mozambican minister of finance who is a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was charged with the same counts
as Boustani, namely one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. Chang was arrested at the request of the United States by South African authorities on Dec. 29,
2018. The United States is seeking Changâs extradition.

Antonio do Rosario, 44, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was an official with Mozambiqueâs State Information and Security Service and a
director and officer of each of the three Mozambican entities that obtained the maritime loans. Do Rosario was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering
in connection with his receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Do Rosario is not currently in U.S. custody.

Teofilo Nhangumele, 50, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, acted on behalf of the Office of the President of Mozambique. Nhangumele was
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his
negotiation and receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Nhangumele is not currently in U.S. custody.

The three investment bankers, Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37, each of whom is a resident of the United
Kingdom, were also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In addition, each banker was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with their roles in facilitating bribe payments to
government officials in Mozambique and for circumventing the internal accounting controls of a foreign investment bank that arranged two of
the loans. At the time, Pearse and Singh were managing directors of the investment bank, and Subeva was a vice president.

Pearse, Singh and Subeva were arrested on Jan. 3, in the United Kingdom, all pursuant to provisional arrest warrants issued at the request of
the United States. The United States is seeking their extradition.

The indictment alleges that between approximately 2013 and 2016, the co-conspirators organized for more than $2 billion in three loans to be
arranged by Investment Bank and another foreign bank. The loans were made to companies owned and controlled by the Mozambican
government: Proindicus S.A., Empresa Mocambicana de Atum, S.A. (EMATUM) and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM). The money was
purportedly to be used to fund three maritime projects for which the shipbuilder, Privinvest, would provide the equipment and services.
Proindicus was to perform coastal surveillance, EMATUM was to engage in tuna fishing, and MAM was to build and maintain shipyards. Chang,
in his capacity as minister of finance, signed guarantees on behalf of Mozambique for all three fraudulent loans. Singh signed the agreements
on behalf of the investment bank for the two loans on which the bank acted as primary arranger. The investment bank subsequently paid the
loans directly to Privinvest.

As further alleged in the indictment, the co-conspirators facilitated Privinvestâs criminal diversion of more than $200 million in loan proceeds,
including more than $150 million in bribe payments to Chang and other Mozambican government officials that Privinvest paid to ensure that
Mozambique would enter into the loan arrangements. In addition to the bribe payments, the alleged fraud also included approximately $50
million in kickback payments to Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, who assisted the conspirators to obtain financing for the loans through their
investment bank and a second foreign investment bank. Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, along with the other members of the conspiracy, allegedly
subsequently sold the loans to investors worldwide, including in the United States. Moreover, the participants in the scheme allegedly
conspired to defraud these investors by misrepresenting how the loan proceeds would be used, the amount and maturity dates of other loans
and debt Mozambique was obligated to pay, and the ability of Mozambique or its state-owned entities to repay the loans.

Mozambique and its state-owned entities have thus far allegedly failed to make more than $700 million of repayments that have become due
on the loans.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

The investigation is being conducted by the FBIâs New York Field Office. The governmentâs case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs
Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Fraud Section, and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York. MLARS Trial Attorneys Sean W. O'Donnell and Margaret A. Moeser, Fraud Section Trial Attorney
David M. Fuhr, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew S. Amatruda and Mark E. Bini of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case. The Department appreciates the significant
cooperation and assistance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Department also appreciates the assistance provided by
law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

Micronesian Government Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Scheme Involving FCPA
Violations

A Micronesian government official pleaded guilty yesterday to a money laundering charge involving bribes made to corruptly secure
engineering and project management contracts from the government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and
Special Agent in Charge Sean Kaul of the FBIâs Honolulu Field Office.

Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen, pleaded guilty in Honolulu before U.S. District Judge Susan O. Mollway of the District of Hawaii to a
one-count information charging him with conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 29, 2019 by Judge
Mollway.

According to his admissions at the plea hearing, Halbert was a government official in the FSM Department of Transportation, Communications
and Infrastructure who administered FSMâs aviation programs, including the management of its airports. Halbert admitted that between 2006
and 2016, a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company owned by Frank James Lyon paid bribes to FSM officials, including Halbert, to
obtain and retain contracts with the FSM government valued at nearly $8 million, in violation of the FCPA. Lyon and Halbert agreed that these
bribe payments would be transported from the United States to the FSM.

In a related matter, Lyon, 53, of Honolulu, Hawaii, pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging
him with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to commit federal program fraud. Lyon is scheduled to be sentenced
on May 13.

Two Members of Billion-Dollar Venezuelan Money Laundering Scheme Arrested

Two alleged participants in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA
using Miami, Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes were arrested yesterday and today.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Matthias Krull, 44, a German national and Panamanian resident, and Gustavo Adolfo Hernandez Frieri, 45, a Colombian national and naturalized
U.S. citizen, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The complaint also charged Francisco Convit
Guruceaga, 40; Jose Vincente Amparan Croquer, aka, âChente,â 44; Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, 44; and Abraham Eduardo Ortega, 51, all
Venezuelan nationals; and Hugo Andre Ramalho Gois, 39, a Portuguese national, and Marcelo Federico Gutierrez Acosta y Lara, 40, a Uruguayan
national, for their alleged participation in the scheme. These defendants remain at large. Krull was arrested last night in Miami and had his
initial court appearance earlier today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes in Miami. Krull is scheduled to have a pre-trial
detention hearing on July 30, and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 8. Frieri was arrested today in Sicily, Italy and faces extradition proceedings.

According to the criminal complaint, the conspiracy in this case allegedly began in December 2014 with a currency exchange scheme that was
designed to embezzle around $600 million from PDVSA, obtained through bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of
the proceeds of that scheme. By May 2015, the conspiracy had allegedly doubled in amount to $1.2 billion embezzled from PDVSA. PDVSA is
Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros).

The complaint alleges that surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are complicit money managers, brokerage
firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

The alleged conspirators include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers, and members of the Venezuelan elite,
sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

The charges contained in the complaint are merely allegations and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

This case is the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) âOperation Money Flight,â a
partnership between and among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate and
prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state
and local law enforcement.

HSI Miami, HS! London, HSI Rome and HSI Madrid investigated this case. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief David Johnson of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco R. Maderal of the Southern District of Floridaâs International Narcotics
and Money Laundering Section.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the
National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom and Italian, Spanish and Maltese law enforcement authorities provided assistance. The Fraud
Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

Panasonic Avionics Corporation Agrees to Pay $137 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act Charges

Panasonic Avionics Corporation (PAC), a subsidiary of multinational electronics company Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic), has agreed to pay
a $137.4 million criminal penalty to resolve charges arising out of a scheme to retain consultants for improper purposes and conceal payments
to third-party sales agents, in violation of the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Acting Assistant Director Christopher Hacker
of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division made the announcement.

âWhen Panasonic Avionics Corporation caused its publicly-traded parent company to falsify its books and records, it distorted the information
available to legitimate investors,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe Criminal Division will take all appropriate action to
ensure that the investing public is able to trust the accuracy of the financial statements of companies that avail themselves of American
securities exchanges.â

âEnforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is critical in maintaining a fair and competitive international market to which all businesses
are entitled,â said Acting Assistant Director Hacker. âAlong with our federal partners and the Department of Justice, the FBI will continue to
aggressively investigate violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

PAC, based in Lake Forest, California, designs and distributes in-flight entertainment systems and global communications services for airlines
and airplane manufacturers. According to admissions and court documents, PAC knowingly and willfully caused Panasonic to falsify its books
and records with respect to PACâs retention of consultants for improper purposes. The consultants, which did little or no actual consulting work
for PAC, were retained through a third-party service provider and were paid for out of a budget over which a senior PAC executive had complete
control and discretion, without meaningful oversight by anyone at PAC or Panasonic. One such individual was offered the consulting position by
PAC at the time that he was employed by a state-owned airline and involved in negotiating a lucrative contract amendment on behalf of the
airline with PAC. According to court documents, that consultant was subsequently paid $875,000 by PAC over a six-year period and PAC earned
over $92 million in profits from portions of the contract over which the consultant had some involvement or influence while employed with the
airline. PAC admitted that it mischaracterized these payments as âconsultant paymentsâ on its general ledger, which it knew caused Panasonic
to incorrectly designate those payments as âselling and general administrative expensesâ on Panasonicâs books, records, and accounts.

PAC also admitted that employees in its Asia region concealed PACâs use of certain sales agents, which did not pass the Companyâs internal
diligence requirements. According to admissions and court documents, PAC formally terminated its relationship with these sales agents, as
required by its compliance policies, but PAC employees then secretly continued to use the agents by having them rehired as sub-agents of
another company, which had passed PACâs due diligence checks. Through this process, PAC employees hid more than $7 million in payments to
at least 13 sub-agents.

By mischaracterizing the payments made to consultants and sales agents and providing false or incomplete representations and Sarbanes-
Oxley subcertifications to Panasonic about PACâs financials and financial controls, PAC caused Panasonic to falsify its books, records, and
accounts in violation of the FCPA.

PAC entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information, filed today in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia, charging the company with one count of knowingly and willfully causing the falsification of the books, records, and
accounts of its parent company Panasonic. As part of the DPA, PAC will pay a total criminal penalty of $137,403,812. PAC also agreed to
continue to cooperate with the departmentâs investigation, enhance its compliance program, implement rigorous internal controls and retain an
independent corporate compliance monitor for at least two years.

In a related proceeding, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Panasonic, whereby the
company agreed to pay approximately $143 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined total
amount of U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties to be paid by Panasonic and PAC is over $280 million.
The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that PAC did not timely voluntarily
self-disclose the conduct, but did cooperate with the departmentâs investigation after receiving a request for documents from the SEC. PAC
received a 20 percent discount off the low end of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of its cooperation and remediation, which,
although untimely in certain respects, did include causing several senior executives who were either involved in or aware of the misconduct to
be separated from PAC or Panasonic. Because many of the companyâs compliance enhancements were more recent, and therefore have not
been tested, the DPA imposes an independent compliance monitor for a term of two years, followed by an additional year of self-reporting to
the department.

The case is being investigated by the FBIâs International Corruption Squad in Los Angeles. Fraud Section Trial Attorneys Dennis R. Kihm and
Jeremy R. Sanders prosecuted the case. The Fraud Section appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this
matter. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided assistance during the investigation.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, November 14, 2019

Two Former Executives of the China Subsidiary of a Multi-Level Marketing Company Charged for
Scheme to Pay Foreign Bribes and Circumvent Internal Accounting Controls

The former head of the China subsidiary of a publicly traded international multi-level marketing company (Company-1) and the former head of
the external affairs department of the China subsidiary of the same company were charged today for their roles in a scheme to violate the anti-
bribery and the internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Yanliang Li, aka âJerry Li,â 51, a citizen of China, the former head and managing director of the China subsidiary of Company-1, was charged
with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of perjury and one count of destruction of records in federal investigations.
Hongwei Yang, aka âMary Yang,â 51, also a citizen of China, the former head of the external affairs department of the China subsidiary of
Company-1, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âLi and Yang allegedly led a brazen, decade-long corruption scheme, bribing foreign Chinese officials and then covering it up by providing false

sworn testimony to the SEC and wiping clean computer files,â said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs
Criminal Division. âThe Department of Justice will continue to hold individuals accountable who undermine the integrity of our financial markets
by participating in these corrupt bribery schemes.â

âLi and Yang, both former top executives of a global multi-level marketing company headquartered in Los Angeles, allegedly approved the
extensive and systematic payments of bribes to Chinese government officials over a 10-year period to promote and expand the companyâs
business in China and to avoid regulatory scrutiny in China,â said U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the Southern District of New York.
âMoreover, in an effort to obstruct the governmentâs investigation into this widespread corruption scheme, Li lied under oath about the bribe
payments when interviewed by the SEC and also destroyed evidence. This case signifies this officeâs commitment to ensuring that companies
operating in the U.S. do not gain an unfair advantage through corruption and illegal bribes of foreign officials.â

According to the allegations in the indictment, from approximately 2007 through February 2017, Li, Yang and others agreed to pay, and paid
bribes to Chinese officials for the purpose of obtaining and retaining licenses for Company-1 to operate as a direct-selling enterprise in
provinces throughout China. The conspirators also are alleged to have paid bribes to corruptly influence Chinese governmental investigations
into Company-1âs compliance with Chinese laws and to corruptly influence Chinese state-owned and state-controlled media for the purpose of
suppressing negative media reports about the company.

In order to carry out the scheme, Li, Yang and others allegedly obtained reimbursement for the bribes they paid to Chinese officials by
submitting false and fraudulent expense claims designed to conceal the true nature of the expenditures at issue, thereby circumventing
Company-1âs internal accounting controls. In addition, Li made false statements under oath in sworn investigative testimony before the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission in New York, New York. Additionally, the indictment alleges that during the course of the federal SEC and
DO] investigations Li, with knowledge of these investigations, installed a âWiping Applicationâ onto his Company-1 issued laptop, which enabled
him to erase 200 files from the laptop in a manner that would render the deleted files unrecoverable.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The FBIâs New York Field Office investigated this case. Trial Attorney Jason Manning of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Joshua A. Naftalis and Scott A. Hartman of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, November 7, 2017

Five Individuals Charged in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving Rolls-Royce Plc and Its U.S.
Subsidiary

Charges were unsealed today against two former executives of Rolls-Royce plc and its subsidiaries (Rolls-Royce), a former Rolls-Royce
employee, a former intermediary for Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan and an executive of an international engineering consulting firm - all for their
alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials for the benefit of a U.S.-based Rolls-Royce subsidiary, including
to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Central Asia to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Inspector in Charge Regina Faulkerson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs
Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece residing in Turkey, was charged by an indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio on Oct. 12, and
unsealed today, with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to launder money,
seven counts of violating the FCPA and 10 counts of money laundering. Contoguris is believed to be outside of the United States. James Finley,
66, a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in Taiwan, pleaded guilty on July 28, before Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of the Southern
District of Ohio, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout, 53, of the
Netherlands; Andreas Kohler, 53, of Austria; and Keith Barnett, 48, of Houston, Texas, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate
the FCPA before Chief Judge Sargus on June 13; June 6; and Dec. 20, 2016, respectively.

âThe charges announced today against executives, employees, and third parties affiliated with Rolls-Royce, is another example of the Criminal
Divisionâs commitment to holding individuals - and not just corporations - accountable for violating the FCPA,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Blanco. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agents - working closely with their counterparts in Brazil and at the
United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, among others - these defendants, many of whom reside overseas, will face justice in this case, which
represents another important step towards leveling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.â

âThe charges unsealed today reflect the determination and ability of the United States to investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in
foreign corrupt business practices, regardless of how sophisticated or far-flung the scheme may be,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âWe can and
will follow the evidence wherever it leads - from Columbus to Kazakhstan and beyond.â

âThis type of sophisticated fraud scheme can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world,â said Inspector in
Charge Faulkerson. âAnyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable. The
U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases. The collaborative
investigative work conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect
the United States and the international marketplace.â

âTodayâs indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own
personal gain,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to
perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the
global marketplace.â

âTodayâs charges demonstrate the immense capabilities of the FBIâs Washington Field Office international corruption program and the global
impact of the anti-corruption program,â said Assistant Director in Charge Vale. âThe FBI is committed to holding accountable those who disrupt
the level playing field to which companies in the United States and around the world are entitled.â

According to the indictment and informations unsealed today, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE.
International Ltd. (Gravitas); Finley, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce; Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-
Royce; Zuurhout, a former energy sales employee at Rolls-Royce; and Kohler, a managing director at an international engineering and
consulting firm, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy
Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based manufacturer and distributor of
power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including
Kohler, devised a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett and Finley, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay
kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees, and bribes to at least one foreign official, and disguise these payments as commissions to
Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The indictment further alleges that after AGP
awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and
Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees knowing that they would share that
money with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy, going as far back as approximately 1999
and continuing into 2013, to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials
in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and
instrumentalities across the globe.

The charges announced today follow the announcement on Jan. 17, of a deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than
$800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice and U.K. and Brazilian authorities related
to the corrupt conduct. The agreement acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into
individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI
formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial
Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder and Assistant Chief Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Michael J. Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the
Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Four Businessmen and Two Foreign Officials Plead Guilty in Connection with Bribes Paid to
Mexican Aviation Officials

Charges were unsealed against six individuals, all of whom have pleaded guilty for their involvement in schemes to bribe Mexican officials in
order to secure aircraft maintenance and repair contracts with government-owned and controlled entities, and two for conspiring to launder the
proceeds of the schemes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-
HSI) in Houston, Special Agent in Charge Shane Folden of ICE-HSI in San Antonio and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

âThe six convictions announced today demonstrate the departmentâs commitment to holding accountable those who further official corruption
through bribery,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese convictions are the result of a coordinated effort by prosecutors and agents
who built the cases brick by brick using traditional law enforcement techniques.â

âHSI special agents and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively investigate financial crimes committed by corrupt foreign
officials,â said Special Agent in Charge Folden. âThis case serves as a reminder that HSI will use all its resources to identify, investigate and
dismantle these criminal networks wherever they operate.â

âThe individuals involved in this scheme paid millions of dollars in bribes to foreign officials in exchange for aviation contracts that placed
legitimate businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Clâs role in unraveling this scheme
assisted in facilitating the guilty pleas that were announced today.â

Douglas Ray, 55, of Magnolia, Texas, and Victor Hugo Valdez Pinon, 54, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty on Oct. 28 and Oct. 26, 2016,
respectively, before U.S. District Judge Alfred H. Bennett of the Southern District of Texas to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Kamta Ramnarine, 69, and Daniel Perez, 69, both of Brownsville, Texas, both pleaded guilty on
Nov. 2, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa of the Southern District of Texas to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA.
Ramnarine and Perez are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 30, 2017. Ray and Valdez Pinon are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 23, 2016.

Ernesto Hernandez Montemayor, 55, and Ramiro Ascencio Nevarez, 58, both of whom are citizens of Mexico and were previous officials of
Mexican state government entities, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hernandez Montemayor
pleaded guilty before Judge Bennett on Dec. 9, 2015, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 12, 2017. Nevarez pleaded guilty before Judge
Hinojosa on March 4, 2016, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison on May 27, 2016.

According to the defendantsâ plea agreements, between 2006 and 2016, Ray conspired with Valdez and others to bribe Mexican officials. The
defendants and their co-conspirators, who owned or were associated with companies in the United States that provided aircraft maintenance,
repair, overhaul and related services to customers from the United States and Mexico, paid the bribes in order to secure parts and servicing
contracts with Mexican government-owned customers. Ray agreed to pay bribes to at least seven different foreign officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor, sometimes paying the bribes via wire transfer and checks to accounts in the United States controlled by the officials.
As part of his guilty plea, Hernandez Montemayor admitted that while employed by a Mexican state government, he accepted bribes from Ray,
Ramnarine, Perez and others in exchange for taking certain actions to assist companies they owned in winning business with Hernandez
Montemayorâs state government employer. Hernandez Montemayor also admitted that he conspired with Ray, Ramnarine, Perez and others to
launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

Ramnarine and Perez admitted that, in addition to bribing Hernandez Montemayor, they also conspired to pay bribes to several other foreign
officials between 2007 and 2015 to ensure that their Brownsville-based company won aircraft parts and services contracts with Mexican
government-owned customers. As part of his guilty plea, Nevarez admitted that while employed by a Mexican public university, he accepted
bribes from Ramnarine and Perez in exchange for taking certain actions to assist their company in winning business with the university.
Nevarez also admitted that he conspired with Ramnarine, Perez and others to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

In total, Ray, Valdez Pinon, Ramnarine, Perez and their co-conspirators paid more than $2 million in bribes to Mexican officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor and Nevarez, in order to secure aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul contracts.

ICE-HSI and IRS-CI are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and Kevin R. Gingras of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jesse Salazar and Arthur Jones of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's
Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, February 15, 2019

Former President and Former Chief Legal Officer of Publicly Traded Fortune 200 Technology
Services Company Indicted in Connection with Alleged Multi-Million Dollar Foreign Bribery
Scheme

A federal grand jury returned an indictment yesterday against the former president and the former chief legal officer of Cognizant Technology
Solutions Corporation, a publicly traded Fortune 200 technology services company based in Teaneck, New Jersey, in connection with an alleged
foreign bribery scheme.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito of the District of
New Jersey and Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie of the FBI Newark Field Office made the announcement.

Gordon Coburn, 55, of Beaver Creek, Colorado, and Steven Schwartz, 51, of Greenwich, Connecticut, were charged in a 12-count indictment
with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), three counts of violating the FCPA, seven counts of falsifying
books and records, and one count of circumventing and failing to implement internal accounting controls. The charges stem from an alleged
scheme to bribe one or more government officials in India to ensure the issuance of a construction permit necessary to complete the
development of an office campus that would support thousands of employees and become one of Cognizantâs largest facilities in India.

The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty of the District of New Jersey. The defendants are scheduled to appear this afternoon
before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Falk in Newark federal court.

âThe allegations in the indictment filed yesterday describe a sophisticated international bribery scheme authorized and concealed by C-suite
executives of a publicly-traded multinational company,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe indictment of Gordon Coburn and
Steven Schwartz demonstrates the Departmentâs commitment to relentlessly pursuing corporate fraud and corruption wherever it is found.â

According to the indictment, in or about April 2014, Coburn and Schwartz allegedly authorized an unlawful payment of approximately $2 million
to one or more foreign government officials in India to secure and obtain a necessary permit to open a new office campus. To conceal
Cognizantâs involvement in the scheme, Coburn, Schwartz and others allegedly agreed that a third-party construction company would obtain
the permit by making the illegal bribe payment and that Cognizant would reimburse the construction company through phony construction
invoices at the end of the project. The indictment further alleges that in or about late June 2014, after the co-conspirators had agreed that the
construction company would make the bribe payment on behalf of Cognizant, the construction company secured the necessary government
order for Cognizant to obtain the permit, allowing Cognizant to complete the development of the office campus and avoid millions of dollars in
costs. Months later, the co-conspirators are alleged to have knowingly caused Cognizant to funnel over $2 million to the construction company
disguised as payment for cost overruns on the office campus when they knew that the actual purpose of the payment was to reimburse the
construction company for the bribe payment. According to the indictment, as Coburn, Schwartz and others had previously agreed, they hid the
bribe reimbursement payment within a series of line items in a construction change order request to be paid to the construction company,
thereby concealing the true nature and purpose of the reimbursement, falsifying Cognizantâs books and records, and circumventing and failing
to implement its internal controls.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

The Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the District of New Jersey also announced today that they have declined
prosecution of Cognizant after considering the factors set forth in the Department of Justiceâs Principles of Prosecution of Business Organizations
and the Corporate Enforcement Policy, including Cognizantâs prompt voluntary self-disclosure, cooperation and remediation, as well as
Cognizantâs disgorgement to the Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the cost savings that resulted from the
bribery scheme.

In the related case with the SEC, Cognizant entered into a cease and desist order and agreed to pay the SEC a civil penalty, disgorgement and
prejudgment interest totaling approximately $25 million. The Company will pay $16,394,351 in disgorgement of profits within the time limits
prescribed by 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2462 to the SEC, and the remaining $2,976,210 to the U.S. Treasury.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, February 18, 2016

VimpelCom Limited and Unitel LLC Enter into Global Foreign Bribery Resolution of More Than
$795 Million; United States Seeks $850 Million Forfeiture in Corrupt Proceeds of Bribery Scheme

Companies Agree to Pay $230 Million U.S. Criminal Fine in Connection with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Resolution; Largest Case Ever Brought
under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative

Amsterdam-based VimpelCom Limited, the worldâs sixth-largest telecommunications company and an issuer of publicly traded securities in the
United States, and its wholly owned Uzbek subsidiary, Unitel LLC, entered into resolutions with the Department of Justice today in which they
admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $114 million in bribery payments to a government official in Uzbekistan between 2006 and 2012 to
enable them to enter and continue operating in the Uzbek telecommunications market.

Ina related action, the department also filed a civil complaint today seeking the forfeiture of more than $550 million held in Swiss bank
accounts, which constitute bribe payments made by VimpelCom and two separate telecommunications companies, or funds involved in the
laundering of those payments, to the Uzbek official. The forfeiture complaint follows an earlier civil complaint filed on June 29, 2015, which
seeks forfeiture of more than $300 million in bank and investment accounts held in Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland that also constitute funds
traceable to bribes, or funds involved in the laundering of the bribes, paid by VimpelCom and another telecommunications company to the
same Uzbek official.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of the Southern District
of New York, Chief Richard Weber of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) and Special Agent in Charge Clark E. Settles of the
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) Washington, D.C., Field Office.

âThese cases combine a landmark FCPA resolution for corporate bribery with one of the largest forfeiture actions we have ever brought to
recover bribe proceeds from a corrupt government official,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThe Criminal Divisionâs FCPA
enforcement program and our Kleptocracy Initiative are two sides of the same anti-corruption coin. The FCPA resolution in this case is also one
of the most significant coordinated international and multi-agency resolutions in the history of the FCPA, and demonstrates our commitment
both to pursuing justice and to bringing about corporate reform.â

âToday we mark the resolution of criminal charges and civil proceedings against corrupt corporate entities that made bribery a foundation of
their business model,â said U.S. Attorney Bharara. âAs they have admitted in court filings, VimpelCom, the worldâs sixth largest
telecommunications company, with securities traded in New York, and its subsidiary, Unitel, built their business in Uzbekistan on over $114
million in bribes funneled to a government official. Those payments, falsely recorded in the companyâs books and records, were then laundered
through bank accounts and assets around the world, including through accounts in New York.â

âToday's admission of guilt by VimpelCom and Unitel to paying bribes to government officials is a victory for all who fight corruption at all
levels,â said Chief Weber. âIt also demonstrates the skill and tenacity of IRS Criminal Investigation special agents when it comes to delving
underneath layers of financial transactions designed to conceal illegal payments for gain. The global economy demands a level playing field for
all. When certain VimpelCom and Unitel executives chose to use deception in order to continue this scheme and take advantage of insider
knowledge, they also chose to become criminals. IRS-Cl pledges to continue our efforts on the international stage to stop corrupt financial
schemes such as this one.â

âHSI special agents and our law enforcement partners will continue to investigate financial crimes committed by corrupt foreign officials,â said
Special Agent in Charge Settles. âWe will not permit ill-gotten gains to be laundered through U.S. financial markets.â

The Criminal Resolution

In the criminal case, Unitel pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a one-count criminal information filed today in the Southern District of New
York and assigned to U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York, charging the company with a conspiracy to violate
the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

VimpelCom entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with a criminal information charging the company with conspiracy to
violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA, and a separate count of violating the internal controls provisions of the
FCPA. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, VimpelCom agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $230,326,398.40 to the United
States, including $40 million in forfeiture. VimpelCom also agreed to implement rigorous internal controls, retain a compliance monitor for a
term of three years and cooperate fully with the departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals.

In related proceedings, VimpelCom settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Prosecution Service of the
Netherlands (Openbaar Ministrie, or OM). Under the terms of its resolution with the SEC, VimpelCom agreed to a total of $375 million in
disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest, to be divided between the SEC and OM. VimpelCom agreed to pay the OM a criminal penalty
of $230 million, for a total criminal penalty of $460,326,398.40, and a total resolution amount of more than $835 million. The department
agreed to credit the criminal penalty paid to the OM as part of its agreement with the company. The SEC agreed to credit the forfeiture paid to
the department as part of its agreement with the company. Thus, the combined total amount of U.S. and Dutch criminal and regulatory
penalties paid by VimpelCom will be $795,326,398.40, making it one of the largest global foreign bribery resolutions ever.
According to the companiesâ admissions, VimpelCom and Unitel, through various executives and employees, paid bribes to an Uzbek
government official, who was a close relative of a high-ranking government official and had influence over the Uzbek governmental body that
regulated the telecom industry. The companies structured and concealed the bribes through various payments to a shell company that certain
VimpelCom and Unitel management knew was beneficially owned by the foreign official. The bribes were paid on multiple occasions between
approximately 2006 and 2012 so that VimpelCom could enter the Uzbek market and Unitel could gain valuable telecom assets and continue
operating in Uzbekistan. VimpelCom and Unitel contemplated additional bribes in 2013, but those bribes were not completed before
VimpelCom opened an internal investigation.

In addition, VimpelCom admitted that it falsified its books and records and attempted to conceal and disguise the bribery scheme by classifying
payments as equity transactions, consulting and repudiation agreements and reseller transactions. VimpelCom also failed to implement and
enforce adequate internal accounting controls, which allowed the bribe payments to occur without detection or remediation. Moreover, when
the board of directors sought an FCPA legal opinion assessing corruption risks involved in the transactions, certain VimpelCom management
withheld crucial information from outside counsel performing the review that restricted the scope of FCPA opinions, rendering them worthless.
Rather than implement and enforce a strong anti-corruption ethic, certain VimpelCom executives sought ways to give the company plausible
deniability of illegality while knowingly proceeding with corrupt business transactions.

A number of significant factors contributed to the departmentâs criminal resolution with the companies. Among these, the companies received
significant credit for their prompt acknowledgement of wrongdoing after being informed of the departmentâs investigation, for their willingness
to promptly resolve their criminal liability on an expedited basis and for their extensive cooperation with the departmentâs investigation.
Specifically, the criminal penalty reflects a 45 percent reduction off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range. However, the
companies did not receive more significant mitigation credit, either in the penalty or the form of resolution, because the companies did not
voluntarily self-disclose their misconduct to the department after an internal investigation uncovered wrongdoing.

The Forfeiture Complaints

The department has also filed two civil complaints seeking a total of $850 million in forfeiture. A complaint filed today seeks forfeiture of
approximately $550 million in proceeds of illegal bribes paid, or property involved in the laundering of those payments, to the Uzbek official by
VimpelCom and two other telecommunications companies operating in Uzbekistan. The $550 million is currently located in Swiss bank
accounts. The department also filed a prior complaint seeking forfeiture of an additional $300 million in proceeds of illegal bribes paid, or
property involved in the laundering of those payments, to the same Uzbek official. The assets sought to be forfeited in that complaint are
restrained in Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland. In that case, on Jan. 11, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
entered a partial default judgment against all potential claimants other than the Republic of Uzbekistan.

As alleged in the complaints and as is part of the criminal resolutions announced today, the telecom companies paid a total of more than $800
million in bribes so that the Uzbek official would assist VimpelCom and other telecommunications companies in obtaining and retaining business
in Uzbekistan. Thereafter, the officialâs associates laundered the corruption proceeds through accounts held in Latvia, the United Kingdom,
Hong Kong, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The illicit funds were transmitted through financial institutions in the United States
before they were deposited into accounts in these countries, thereby subjecting them to U.S. jurisdiction.

The department brought these forfeiture actions under the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative in the Criminal Divisionâs Asset Forfeiture and
Money Laundering Section (AFMLS), working in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official
corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed by corruption and abuse of office.

* * *

These cases represent the departmentâs commitment to both prosecute those who pay bribes and to ensure that the corrupt government
officials who receive the bribes cannot use the U.S. financial system to launder their illicit gains. The IRS-Cl and ICE-HSI are investigating the
cases, along with the IRS Global Illicit Financial Team in Washington, D.C. Senior Litigation Counsel Nicola J. Mrazek and Trial Attorney Ephraim
Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Imperatore of the Southern District of New York are
prosecuting the criminal case, with substantial assistance from AFMLS. AFMLS Trial Attorney Marie M. Dalton is prosecuting the forfeiture case
with substantial assistance from the Fraud Section.

Law enforcement colleagues within the OM, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland and the
Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau in Latvia provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter. Law enforcement
colleagues in Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom have also provided valuable assistance. The Criminal Divisionâs
Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The SEC referred the matter to the department and provided
extensive cooperation and assistance.

Individuals with information about possible proceeds of foreign corruption located in or laundered through the United States should contact
federal law enforcement or send an email to kleptocracy@usdoj.gov.

Former Member of Barbados Parliament and Minister of Industry Found Guilty of Receiving and
Laundering Bribes from Barbadian Insurance Company

A former member of the Barbados Parliament, who also served as the Minister of Industry of Barbados, was found guilty today by a federal jury
for his role in a scheme to launder bribes paid to him by executives of the Insurance Corporation of Barbados Limited (ICBL).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

Following a one-week trial and two hours of jury deliberations, Donville Inniss, 54, a U.S. legal permanent resident who resided in Tampa,
Florida, and Barbados, was found guilty of two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Sentencing has not yet been scheduled.

According to the evidence presented at trial, in 2015 and 2016, Inniss took part in a scheme to launder into the United States approximately
$36,000 in bribes that he received from high-level executives of ICBL. At the time, Inniss was a member of the Parliament of Barbados and the
Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce, and Small Business Development of Barbados. The trial evidence demonstrated that, in
exchange for the bribes, Inniss leveraged his position as the Minister of Industry to enable ICBL to obtain two insurance contracts from the
Barbados government to insure over $100 million worth of government property. To conceal the bribes, Inniss arranged to receive them
through a U.S. bank account in the name of his friendâs dental company, which had an address in Elmont, New York. The trial evidence further
showed that Inniss used a personal email account to communicate with an executive from ICBL in connection with the bribe payments and the
laundering of the money through the dental company in New York.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in New York City investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption Squads across
the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial Attorney Gerald M. Moody Jr. of the Criminal Divisionâs
Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David Gopstein and Sylvia Shweder of the Eastern District of New York prosecuted the case. The
Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided assistance in this matter. The Department appreciates the cooperation provided
by its law enforcement colleagues in Barbados during this investigation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, November 17, 2016

JPMorganâs Investment Bank in Hong Kong Agrees to Pay $72 Million Penalty for Corrupt Hiring
Scheme in China

JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Limited (JPMorgan APAC), a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of multinational bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPMC),
agreed to pay a $72 million penalty for its role in a scheme to corruptly gain advantages in winning banking deals by awarding prestigious jobs
to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York and
Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThe so-called Sons and Daughters Program was nothing more than bribery by another name,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.
âAwarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and
simple. This case demonstrates the Criminal Divisionâs commitment to uncovering corruption no matter the form of the scheme.â

âU.S. businesses cannot lawfully seek to gain a business advantage by corruptly influencing foreign government officials,â said U.S. Attorney
Capers. âThe common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defense. In this case, JPMorgan employees designed a
program to hire otherwise unqualified candidates for prestigious investment banking jobs solely because these candidates were referred to the
bank by officials in positions to award business to the bank. In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that
the hiring was linked to the award of specific business. This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.â

âCreating a barter system in which jobs are awarded to applicants in exchange for lucrative business deals is a corrupt scheme in and of itself,â
said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âBut when foreign officials are among those involved in the bribe, the international free market
system and our national security are among the major threats we face. Those engaging in these illegal acts abroad may think they're out of
sight and out of mind, but they're wrong. The FBI has recently established three dedicated international corruption squads to combat this type
of quid pro quo, and we'll use all resources at our disposal to uncover and put an end to these crimes.â

According to JPMorgan APACâs admissions, beginning in 2006, senior Hong Kong-based investment bankers set up and used a âclient referral
program,â also referred to as the âSons and Daughters Program,â to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials. The Sons and
Daughters Program was used as a means to influence those same officials to award investment deals to JPMorgan APAC. By late 2009,
JPMorgan APAC executives and senior bankers revamped the client referral program to improve its efficacy by prioritizing those hires linked to
upcoming client transactions. In order to be hired, a referred candidate had to have a âdirectly attributable linkage to business opportunity.â

According to admissions made in connection with the resolution, these guid pro quo arrangements were discussed internally among JPMorgan
APAC bankers. For example, in late 2009, a Chinese government official communicated to a senior JPMorgan APAC banker that hiring a referred
candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan APAC would receive in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) for a Chinese state-
owned company. The banker communicated this message to several senior colleagues, who then spent several months trying to place the
referred candidate in an investment banking position in New York. Despite learning from personnel in New York that this referred candidate
was not qualified for an investment banking position, senior JPMorgan APAC bankers created a new position for the candidate in New York, and
JPMorgan APAC thereafter obtained a leading role in the IPO. Further, JPMorgan APAC employees misused compliance questionnaires to justify
and paper over corrupt business arrangements. Employees also used a template with pre-filled answers, including that there was âno expected
benefitâ from the hire, and compliance personnel drafted and modified questionnaires that failed to state the true purpose of the hire.

JPMorgan APAC further admitted that candidates hired during the scheme were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as
entry-level investment bankers, despite the fact that many of these hires performed ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real
value to any deliverable product.

The corrupt scheme netted JPMorgan APAC at least $35 million in profits from business mandates with Chinese state-owned companies.

JPMorgan APAC entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $72 million to resolve the matter. As part of
the agreement, JPMorgan APAC has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions
relating to the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program, and to report to the department on the implementation of
its enhanced compliance program.

The department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that JPMorgan APAC did not voluntarily and timely disclose the
conduct at issue. However, JPMorgan APAC did receive full credit for its and JPMCâs cooperation with the criminal investigation, including
conducting a thorough internal investigation, making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States and producing
documents to the government from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws. JPMorgan APAC also took
significant employment action against six employees who participated in the misconduct resulting in their departure from the bank, and it
disciplined an additional 23 employees who, although not involved in the misconduct, failed to effectively detect the misconduct or supervise
those engaged in it. JPMorgan APAC imposed more than $18.3 million in financial sanctions on former or current employees in connection with
the remediation efforts. Based on these actions and other considerations, the company received a non-prosecution agreement and an
aggregate discount of 25 percent off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against JPMC, whereby JPMC agreed
to pay $130.5 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. The Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors also
issued a consent cease-and-desist order and assessed a $61.9 million civil penalty. Thus, the combined U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties
paid by JPMC and its Hong Kong subsidiary are approximately $264.4 million.

The FBIâs New York Field Office investigated the case. The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the
SEC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in this matter. Assistant Deputy Chief Leo Tsao and Trial Attorneys James P. McDonald and
Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney James P. Loonam of the Eastern District of New Yorkâs
Business and Securities Fraud Section prosecuted the case.

Two Men Charged in Ecuadorian Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme

Criminal complaints have been unsealed charging two Ecuadorian citizens for their alleged roles in a bribery and money laundering scheme
involving Ecuadorâs public police pension fund (ISSPOL).

John Luzuriaga Aguinaga, 52, and Jorge Cherrez Minho, 46, were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in
complaints filed in the Southern District of Florida on Feb. 10 and Feb. 19, respectively. Luzuriaga was arrested Feb. 26 and had his initial
appearance Monday. An arrest warrant has been issued for Cherrez who is believed to be in Mexico.

As alleged in the complaints, between approximately 2014 and 2020, Cherrez, an investment advisor, paid more than $2.6 million in bribes to
ISSPOL officials, including at least approximately $1,397,066 to Luzuriaga, ISSPOLâs Risk Director and a member of ISSPOLâs Investment
Committee, in order to obtain and retain investment business from ISSPOL. Cherrez allegedly obtained approximately $65 million in profits from
one aspect of the scheme.

According to the complaint, Cherrez received payments from the ISSPOL investment business in an account in the United States, used Florida-
based companies and bank accounts to pay the bribes, and took acts in furtherance of the bribery scheme while in the Southern District of
Florida. Further, to conceal and promote the bribery scheme, Cherrez and Luzuriaga allegedly laundered the corrupt proceeds through Florida-
based companies and bank accounts, including numerous U.S. investment fund companies incorporated in Florida with Cherrez as an officer or
director.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Kelly Jackson of
the IRS-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Washington, D.C. office, and Special Agent in Charge Anthony Salisbury of U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami office made the announcement.

This case is being investigated by HSI and IRS-Cl, jointly under the auspices of the Global Illicit Financial Team. Trial Attorneys Katherine Raut
and Alexander Kramer of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section are prosecuting the case. Southern District of Florida Assistant United States
Attorney Annika Miranda is handling asset forfeiture.

The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs has provided significant assistance in this case.

Miami Businessman Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Fraud Charges in Connection with
Venezuela Bribery Scheme

The owner of multiple U.S.-based energy companies pleaded guilty yesterday to foreign bribery and fraud charges for his role in a scheme to
corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Acting Special Agent in Charge Sean McElroy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (ICE-HSI) in Houston and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston
Field Office made the announcement.

Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 52, of Coral Gables, Florida, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court before U.S. District Judge Gray H.
Miller of the Southern District of Texas in Houston to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and commit
wire fraud and one count of violating the FCPA. Sentencing is scheduled for July 8, 2016. Four others charged in relation to the case have
pleaded guilty, including three foreign officials.

âThe five convictions announced today hold to account bribe payors as well as the corrupt foreign officials who laundered the bribe money
through the United States,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese individual prosecutions are the result of a tenacious and
coordinated effort by our prosecutors and agents to unravel a complex web of bribes paid to Venezuelan officials. And they demonstrate our
commitment to building cases from the ground up, instead of counting on companies and other wrongdoers to self-disclose their crimes.â

âThe pleas of guilty in this case are the result of the strict enforcement of the FCPA in this district,â said U.S. Attorney Magidson. âBribery under
this law is a serious federal crime that undermines commercial and political relations around the world. This case is an example of our reach to
expose this criminal conduct.â

Shiera was arrested in Miami on Dec. 16, 2015, after a federal grand jury returned an 18-count indictment against him and Roberto Enrique
Rincon Fernandez (Rincon), 55, of The Woodlands, Texas. According to admissions made in connection with Shieraâs plea, Shiera and Rincon
worked together to submit bids to provide equipment and services to PDVSA through their various companies. Shiera admitted that beginning
in 2009, he and Rincon agreed to pay bribes and other things of value to PDVSA purchasing analysts to ensure that his and Rinconâs companies
were placed on PDVSA bidding panels, which enabled the companies to win lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA. Shiera also made bribe
payments to other PDVSA officials in order to ensure that his companies were placed on PDVSA-approved vendor lists and given payment
priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding invoices, he admitted.

âThe corruption of foreign officials through bribery has a damaging impact on the stability of trade, industries and even nations,â said Acting
Special Agent in Charge McElroy. âHSI and our partners will tirelessly investigate anyone who cultivates the corruption of officials abroad and
bribe their way to financial gain.â

âBribery and corruption undermines honest, free enterprise and creates an atmosphere of back room dealing that impairs the ability for honest
businesses to compete,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Cl tirelessly untangles the web of illicit transactions that lead to corrupt
individuals being held accountable.â

Judge Miller also unsealed charges yesterday against four other individuals charged in connection with the investigation. In January 2016,
Moises Abraham Millan Escobar (Millan), 32, of Katy, Texas, pleaded guilty under seal to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA for his role
in the PDVSA bribery scheme. Millan was Shieraâs former employee. In December 2015, three former PDVSA officials, Jose Luis Ramos Castillo
(Ramos), 38; Christian Javier Maldonado Barillas (Maldonado), 39; and Alfonzo Eliezer Gravina Munoz (Gravina), 53, all from Katy, each pleaded
guilty under seal to conspiracy to commit money laundering. As part of their guilty pleas, Ramos, Maldonado and Gravina each admitted that
while employed by PDVSA or its wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliates, they accepted bribes from Shiera and Rincon in exchange for taking
certain actions to assist companies owned by Shiera and Rincon in winning energy contracts with PDVSA. Ramos, Maldonado and Gravina also
admitted that they conspired with Shiera and Rincon to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme. Gravina also pleaded guilty to making
false statements on his 2010 federal income tax return by failing to report the bribe payments he received from Shiera, Rincon and others. As
part of their plea agreements, Shiera, Millan, Ramos, Maldonado and Gravina all agreed to forfeit proceeds of their criminal activity.

Five Former Venezuelan Government Officials Charged in Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Foreign Bribery

Charges were unsealed today against five former Venezuelan government officials for their alleged participation in an international money
laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy
company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Two of the five defendants are also charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Four of the defendants, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 50; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 50; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39, were arrested in Spain in October 2017 by Spanish authorities on arrest
warrants based on a 20-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Aug. 23, 2017. Cesar Rincon was extradited from Spain
on Feb. 9, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge MJ Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas. De Leon,
Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spanish custody pending extradition. A fifth defendant, Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33, remains at large.
All five defendants are citizens of Venezuela; De Leon is also a U.S. citizen.

De Leon, Villalobos, Reiter and Isturiz are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Cesar Rincon is charged
with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each of the defendants is charged with one or more counts of money laundering,
as follows: De Leon, Cesar Rincon and Reiter, four counts each; Villalobos, one count; and Isturiz, five counts. De Leon and Villalobos are also
each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âCorruption threatens economic and political stability, and victimizes ordinary law-abiding people by diverting public funds into the pockets of
corrupt officials and bribe payers,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe charges announced today demonstrate our
commitment to fighting corruption at its source and to prosecuting those who allegedly launder their illicit gains through American financial
institutions and real estate. Through cases like this, we are sending a strong message to corrupt foreign officials: if you launder your ill-gotten
gains through the United States, you will be prosecuted.â

âEffective deterrence of corruption requires prosecution of culpable individuals, wherever those individuals are located,â said U.S. Attorney
Patrick. âWe will continue to enforce the FCPA against those that avail themselves of the privileges of the American marketplace.â

âThis case is an example of what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to thwart complex cross-
border crimesâ said Special Agent in Charge Dawson. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would
participate in illegal practices.

The indictment alleges that the five defendants, all of whom were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other
Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, were known as the âmanagement teamâ and wielded significant influence within PDVSA.
According to the indictment, the management team conspired with each other and others to solicit several PDVSA vendors, including vendors
who were residents of the United States, and who owned and controlled businesses incorporated and based in the United States, for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business. The indictment further alleges that
the co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions,
including to, from or through bank accounts in the United States, and, in some instances, laundered the bribe proceeds in the form of real
estate transactions and other investments in the United States.

According to the indictment, two PDVSA vendors, Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, sent over $27 million in bribe payments to an account in Switzerland for
which De Leon was a beneficial owner and De Leon and Villalobos were authorized signers. The indictment alleges that those funds were later
transferred to other accounts in Switzerland. Both Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to
FCPA charges in connection with a scheme to bribe PDVSA officials. According to admissions made in connection with their pleas, Roberto
Rincon and Shiera paid bribes and provided other things of value to PDVSA officials to ensure that their companies were placed on PDVSA
bidding panels and ensure that they were given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding
invoices. Roberto Rincon and Shiera are currently awaiting sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 15 individuals, 10 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys
Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District
of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Business Executive Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery Charge in Connection With Venezuelan
Bribery Scheme

A former manager of a U.S.-based logistics and freight forwarding company pleaded guilty to a foreign bribery charge today for his role ina
scheme to corruptly secure contracts and contract extensions from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). The guilty plea of the foreign official who was bribed was also unsealed today.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigationsâ
(HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Juan Carlos Castillo Rincon (Castillo), 55, of Conroe, Texas, previously of Miami, Florida, pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy K.
Johnson of the Southern District of Texas in Houston to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Castillo is
scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21, 2019 by U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller of the Southern District of Texas.

Judge Johnson also unsealed the guilty plea of Jose Orlando Camacho (Camacho), 46, of Miami, Florida, previously of Katy, Texas, the PDVSA
official whom Castillo bribed. In July 2017, Camacho pleaded guilty under seal before Judge Miller to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Camacho is also scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 21, 2019 by Judge Miller.

âCorruption undermines the rule of law, tilts the playing field away from law-abiding businesses, and exposes our financial system to the
distorting effects of illicit cash flows,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe guilty pleas announced today are the latest in a series
of actions arising out of an ongoing investigation of bribery at PDVSA. The Department will continue to combat corruption wherever we find it.â

âThese guilty pleas reflect the hard work of agents and investigators and mark another step in the joint effort to combat foreign corruption,â
said U.S. Attorney Patrick. âOur office will continue to prosecute those who bribe foreign officials or use our financial networks to launder the
proceeds of these bribes.â

âForeign bribery schemes like this pose a significant threat to the public trust and fair trade practices,â said HSI Houston Special Agent in
Charge Dawson. âTodayâs pleas are a step in the right direction, but we will continue to aggressively investigate individuals and corporations
who violate the FCPA to ensure a fair and equal playing field for U.S. companies and consumers.â

Castillo was arrested in Miami on April 19, after a federal grand jury returned a five-count indictment against him. According to admissions
made in connection with Castilloâs plea, beginning in or around 2011 and continuing through at least 2013, Castillo, a manager at a Houston-
based logistics and freight forwarding company, conspired with others to bribe a PDVSA official in exchange for the official providing assistance
in connection with the companyâs business with PDVSA. In exchange for bribe payments, the PDVSA official assisted the company in obtaining
PDVSA contracts, contract extensions and favorable contract terms; provided Castillo with inside information concerning the PDVSA bidding
process; and supported the company in internal PDVSA meetings regarding purchasing decisions.

As part of his guilty plea, Camacho admitted that while employed by PDVSA or its wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliates, he accepted bribes
from Castillo and the logistics and freight forwarding company for which Castillo was a manager in exchange for taking certain actions to assist
the company in its business with PDVSA. Camacho also admitted that he conspired with Castillo to launder the proceeds of the bribery
scheme.

As part of their plea agreements, both Castillo and Camacho have agreed to forfeit the proceeds of their criminal activity.

With Castilloâs plea today and the unsealing of Camachoâs plea, the Justice Department has announced charges against 18 individuals, 14 of
whom have pleaded guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. The HSI Houston Field
Office is conducting the ongoing investigation, with assistance from HSI in Boston and from IRS Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Jeremy R.
Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys John P. Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the
Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas is handling the
forfeiture aspects of the case.

Businessman Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Tax Charges in Connection with Venezuela
Bribery Scheme

The owner of multiple U.S.-based energy companies pleaded guilty today to foreign bribery and tax charges for his role in a scheme to corruptly
secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Acting Special Agent in Charge Sean McElroy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (ICE-HSI) in Houston, and Special Agent in Charge Richard Goss of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl)
Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Rincon), 55, of The Woodlands, Texas, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Houston to an information
charging him with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of violating the FCPA and one count of
making false statements on his 2010 federal income tax return. U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller of the Southern District of Texas accepted
Rinconâs plea and imposed a personal money judgment against Rincon, who agreed to a forfeiture. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 30, 2016.

Rincon was arrested on Dec. 16, 2015, after a grand jury in the Southern District of Texas returned an 18-count indictment against him and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 53, of Coral Gables, Florida.

According to admissions made in connection with Rinconâs plea, Rincon and Shiera worked together to submit bids to provide equipment and
services to PDVSA through their various companies. Rincon admitted that beginning in 2009, he and Shiera agreed to pay bribes and other
things of value to PDVSA purchasing analysts to ensure that his and Shieraâs companies were placed on PDVSA bidding panels, which enabled
the companies to win lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA. Rincon also admitted to making bribe payments to other PDVSA officials in order
to ensure that his companies were placed on PDVSA-approved vendor lists and given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of
other PDVSA vendors with outstanding invoices. In his plea agreement, Rincon admitted that he willfully failed to report on his 2010 federal tax
return over $6 million in foreign dividend income he received from a Venezuelan corporation he owned.

Rincon is the sixth individual to plead guilty as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. Shiera
previously pleaded guilty before Judge Miller to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud and one count of violating
the FCPA and is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 30, 2016. In March 2016, Judge Miller also unsealed charges against four other individuals
charged in connection with the ongoing investigation, including three foreign officials. The foreign officials admitted that while employed by
PDVSA or its wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliates, they accepted bribes from Rincon and Shiera in exchange for taking certain actions to assist
companies owned by Rincon and Shiera in winning energy contracts with PDVSA. The foreign officials also conspired with Rincon and Shiera to
launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme, they admitted. As part of their plea agreements, Rincon, Shiera and the other defendants all
agreed to forfeit proceeds from their criminal activity.

ICE-HSI and IRS-Cl are conducting the ongoing investigation, with assistance from the FBI. Trial Attorneys Aisling OâShea and Jeremy R. Sanders
of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of

Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kristine Rollinson and Vincent Carroll of the Southern District of Texas are handling the
forfeiture aspects of the case.

Oil Executives Plead Guilty for Roles in Bribery Scheme Involving Foreign Officials

The former CEO and chief operations officer (COO) of a Monaco-based intermediary company have pleaded guilty for their roles in a scheme to
corruptly facilitate millions of dollars in bribe payments to officials in multiple countries. These included Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Irag, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria. The companyâs former business development director also pleaded guilty
for his role in paying bribes in Libya.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas, Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater of the FBIâs Washington Field Office, Inspector in Charge Adrian Gonzales of the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Houston Division and Special Agent in Charge D. Richard Goss of the IRS-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl)
Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Cyrus Ahsani, 51, and Saman Ahsani, 46, both of United Kingdom (UK), each pleaded guilty March 25 to one count of conspiracy to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), for conspiring to facilitate bribes on behalf of companies in foreign countries in order to secure oil and gas
contracts. UK resident Steven Hunter, 50, former business development director, pleaded guilty Aug. 2, 2018, to one count of conspiracy to
violate the FCPA. Cyrus and Saman Ahsani are set for sentencing April 20, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore of the Southern
District of Texas. Hunterâs sentencing is scheduled for March 13, 2020, before U.S. District Judge David Hittner.

According to court documents, former U.S. resident and CEO Cyrus Ahsani and former COO Saman Ahsani managed a Monaco-based
intermediary company that provided services for multinational companies operating in the energy sector. From approximately 1999 to 2016,
the Ahsanis conspired with others, including multiple companies and individuals, to make millions of dollars in bribe payments to government
officials in Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Irag, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria.

Additionally, court documents reflect Cyrus and Saman Ahsani laundered the proceeds of their bribery scheme in order to promote and conceal
the schemes and to cause the destruction of evidence in order to obstruct investigations in the United States and elsewhere. Hunter
participated in the conspiracy to violate the FCPA by, among other things, facilitating bribe payments to Libyan officials between about 2009
and 2015.

The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation and U.S. Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation. Trial Attorneys Dennis R. Kihm, Gerald M.
Moody Jr., Jonathan P. Robell and Gwendolyn A. Stamper of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Suzanne Elmilady
of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided substantial
assistance in this matter.

The governments of Australia, Canada, France, Guernsey, Italy, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and UK provided significant
assistance in this matter as did the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Eurojust.

Former Executive Director at Venezuelan State-Owned Oil Company, Petroleos De Venezuela,
S.A., Pleads Guilty to Role in Billion-Dollar Money Laundering Conspiracy

A former executive director at the Venezuelan state-owned oil company, PetrÃ©leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), pleaded guilty today for his role
in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from PDVSA.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Abraham Edgardo Ortega, 51, a Venezuelan national, who was PDVSAâs executive director of financial planning, pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 9, 2019 by U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the
Southern District of Florida, who accepted his plea today.

As part of his plea, Ortega admitted that in his position with PDVSA, he accepted $5 million in bribes to give priority loan status to a French
company and a Russian bank, which were both minority shareholders in joint ventures with PDVSA. Ortega was paid for this bribery scheme
with the proceeds of a currency exchange scheme, through which $1.2 billion was embezzled, through bribery and fraud from PDVSA. Ortega
also admitted that in his position with PDVSA, he accepted $12 million in bribes for his participation in a PDVSA embezzlement scheme involving
a loan and foreign-exchange contract.

Ortega admitted that he worked with a co-defendant to launder $12 million that he received as bribe payments. Ortega admitted that he and
his co-defendant laundered $12 million through a sophisticated false-investment scheme that received money from a payment made to look
like an investment into a fund, but, in fact, the payment was actually laundered out of the fund. Surrounding and supporting this false-
investment laundering scheme were complicit money managers, brokerage firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States
and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers, Ortega admitted.

Ortegaâs co-conspirators indicted on Aug. 16 include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers and members of the
Venezuelan elite, sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

This case is the result of ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forceâs (OCDETF) âOperation Money Flight,â a
partnership among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate and prosecute high-level
members of drug trafficking enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state and local law
enforcement.

HSI Miami, HS! London, HSI Rome and HSI Madrid investigated this case. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief David Johnson and
Trial Attorney Gwendolyn A. Stamper of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael B. Nadler of the Southern
District of Floridaâs Economic and Environmental Crimes Section. Assistant U.S. Attorney Nalina Sombuntham of the Southern District of Florida
is handling the asset forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter. The National Crime Agency of the United

Five Former Venezuelan Government Officials Charged in Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Foreign Bribery

Charges were unsealed today against five former Venezuelan government officials for their alleged participation in an international money
laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy
company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Two of the five defendants are also charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Four of the defendants, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 50; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 50; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39, were arrested in Spain in October 2017 by Spanish authorities on arrest
warrants based on a 20-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Aug. 23, 2017. Cesar Rincon was extradited from Spain
on Feb. 9, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge MJ Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas. De Leon,
Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spanish custody pending extradition. A fifth defendant, Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33, remains at large.
All five defendants are citizens of Venezuela; De Leon is also a U.S. citizen.

De Leon, Villalobos, Reiter and Isturiz are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Cesar Rincon is charged
with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each of the defendants is charged with one or more counts of money laundering,
as follows: De Leon, Cesar Rincon and Reiter, four counts each; Villalobos, one count; and Isturiz, five counts. De Leon and Villalobos are also
each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âCorruption threatens economic and political stability, and victimizes ordinary law-abiding people by diverting public funds into the pockets of
corrupt officials and bribe payers,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe charges announced today demonstrate our
commitment to fighting corruption at its source and to prosecuting those who allegedly launder their illicit gains through American financial
institutions and real estate. Through cases like this, we are sending a strong message to corrupt foreign officials: if you launder your ill-gotten
gains through the United States, you will be prosecuted.â

âEffective deterrence of corruption requires prosecution of culpable individuals, wherever those individuals are located,â said U.S. Attorney
Patrick. âWe will continue to enforce the FCPA against those that avail themselves of the privileges of the American marketplace.â

âThis case is an example of what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to thwart complex cross-
border crimesâ said Special Agent in Charge Dawson. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would
participate in illegal practices.

The indictment alleges that the five defendants, all of whom were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other
Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, were known as the âmanagement teamâ and wielded significant influence within PDVSA.
According to the indictment, the management team conspired with each other and others to solicit several PDVSA vendors, including vendors
who were residents of the United States, and who owned and controlled businesses incorporated and based in the United States, for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business. The indictment further alleges that
the co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions,
including to, from or through bank accounts in the United States, and, in some instances, laundered the bribe proceeds in the form of real
estate transactions and other investments in the United States.

According to the indictment, two PDVSA vendors, Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, sent over $27 million in bribe payments to an account in Switzerland for
which De Leon was a beneficial owner and De Leon and Villalobos were authorized signers. The indictment alleges that those funds were later
transferred to other accounts in Switzerland. Both Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to
FCPA charges in connection with a scheme to bribe PDVSA officials. According to admissions made in connection with their pleas, Roberto
Rincon and Shiera paid bribes and provided other things of value to PDVSA officials to ensure that their companies were placed on PDVSA
bidding panels and ensure that they were given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding
invoices. Roberto Rincon and Shiera are currently awaiting sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 15 individuals, 10 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys
Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District
of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Former President of Transportation Company Found Guilty of Violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act and Other Crimes

The former president of Transportation Logistics Inc. (TLI), a Maryland-based transportation company that provides services for the
transportation of nuclear materials to customers in the United States and abroad, was found guilty today for his role in a scheme to bribe an
official at a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation and on related fraud and conspiracy charges.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur of the District of
Maryland and Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater of the FBIâs Washington Field Office and Inspector General Teri L. Donaldson of the
U.S. Department of Energyâs Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) made the announcement.

After a three-week trial, Mark Lambert, 56, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was found guilty of four counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA), two counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud. Sentencing has been scheduled
for March 9, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland, who presided over the trial.

According to the evidence presented at trial, Lambert participated in a scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport
(TENEX), a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and
uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. The trial evidence demonstrated
that, over the course of years, Lambert conspired with others at TLI to make the corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to
Mikerin through offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at Mikerinâs direction. In order to conceal the bribe payments,
Lambert and his co-conspirators caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to TLI, that described services that were never
provided, and then Lambert and others caused TLI to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia,
Cyprus and Switzerland.

The trial evidence further showed that Lambert and other members of the conspiracy used code words like âlucky figures,â âLF,â âlucky
numbersâ and âcakeâ to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at an alias, personal email account under the name âMarvin
Jodel.â The evidence at trial also demonstrated that Lambert and his co-conspirators caused TLI to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the
bribe payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for TLIâs services in order to fund the bribes paid to Mikerin.

This case is being investigated by the FBIâs Washington Field Office and DOE-OIG. Assistant Chief Vanessa A. Sisti and Trial Attorney Derek J.
Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David |. Salem of the District of Maryland are prosecuting the case.

The Department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Switzerlandâs Office of the Attorney
General as well as authorities in Latvia and Cyprus.

Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Charged with Foreign Bribery

The former owner and President of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (generally referred to as the âChestnut
Groupâ) was indicted by a federal grand jury today for his alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to a foreign official in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Travel Act, and to launder proceeds of those crimes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and Special Agent in Charge Edward J. Hanko of the FBIâs Philadelphia Division made the announcement.

âWe are committed to combating foreign corruption, across the globe and across all industries, through enforcement actions and prosecutions
of companies and the individuals who run those companies,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âAs alleged, in this case, the owner and
chief executive of a Pennsylvania financial consulting firm secured hundreds of millions of dollars in business by bribing a European banking
official. He now faces an indictment for corruption in federal court. Bribery of foreign officials undermines the public trust in government and
fair competition in business. The charges returned today reflect the clear message that we will root out corruption and prosecute individuals
who violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âWe will aggressively investigate and prosecute individuals in our district who use corrupt means like bribery to influence foreign officials,â said
U.S. Attorney Memeger. âOur criminal statutes in this arena must be enforced to ensure fair dealing in a competitive global marketplace where
foreign officials often hold significant decision-making authority. The alleged conduct here was particularly reprehensible because it
undermined the legitimacy of a process designed to support businesses for the citizens of developing nations.â

âThis is a great example of the FBIâs ability to successfully coordinate with our international law enforcement partners to tackle corruption,â said
Special Agent in Charge Hanko. âBribery - foreign or domestic - cripples the notion of fair competition in the marketplace.â

Dmitrij Harder, 42, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the former owner and president of the Chestnut Group, was charged with one count of
conspiracy to violate the FCPA and Travel Act, five counts of violating the FCPA, five counts of violating the Travel Act, one count of conspiracy
to commit international money laundering, and two counts of money laundering.

According to allegations in the indictment, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was a multilateral development
bank headquartered in London, England, and was owned by over 60 sovereign nations. Among other things, the EBRD provided financing for
development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern Europe.

According to allegations in the indictment, Harder and others paid bribes for the benefit of a senior official at the EBRD in exchange for
influencing the officialâs actions on applications for financing submitted by the Chestnut Groupâs clients and for directing business to the
Chestnut Group. The EBRD ultimately approved applications for financing from two of the Chestnut Groupâs corporate clients; the first resulted
in the EBRD providing an $85 million investment and a 90 million Euro loan, while the second resulted in a $40 million investment and a $60
million convertible loan. The Chestnut Group allegedly earned approximately $8 million in âsuccess feesâ as a result of the EBRDâs approval of
these two applications.

The indictment alleges that Harder made five payments totaling more than $3.5 million to the sister of the EBRD official, in part as an effort to
conceal the bribes. These payments were allegedly made for purported consulting and other services provided to the Chestnut Group by the
officialâs sister, when in fact she provided no such services. Harder also allegedly participated in creating fake documents to justify these
payments.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The case is being investigated by the FBIâs Philadelphia Division. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs also provided assistance.

The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Leo R. Tsao of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan
of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

Former Armenian Ambassador and a Russian National Charged in Foreign Bribery and Money
Laundering Scheme

Two employees of an international engineering consulting firm were charged in a superseding indictment filed today for their alleged
participation in a scheme to launder bribe payments to foreign government officials for the benefit of a Columbus, Ohio-based subsidiary of
Rolls-Royce plc, to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Kazakhstan to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Acting Inspector in Charge Nicole Davis of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Christopher Hacker of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBIâs Washington
Field Office Criminal Division made the announcement.

Azat Martirossian, 62, a citizen of Armenia, and Vitaly Leshkov, 50, a citizen of Russia, were charged by a superseding indictment filed in the
Southern District of Ohio with one count of conspiracy to launder money and 10 counts of money laundering. Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of
Greece, was also charged on these counts, as well as one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and seven
counts of violating the FCPA. Contoguris previously had been charged on all of these counts in an indictment that was filed on Oct. 12, 2017
and unsealed on Nov. 7, 2017. Martirossian, Leshkov, and Contoguris are believed to be residing outside the United States.

âThe charges announced today against Azat Martirossian and Vitaly Leshkov further demonstrate the Criminal Divisionâs unwavering resolve to
prosecute those who facilitate corruption and launder illicit proceeds,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThanks to the
coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agentsâworking closely with their counterparts throughout the worldâthese defendants will face
prosecution for their allegedly corrupt schemes.â

âThe charges filed today reflect the continued determination of the United States to prosecute those who engage in foreign corrupt business
practices,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âInternational actors should think twice before executing bribery schemes because the United States
can and will discover and prosecute such schemes and their perpetrators.â

âThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases,â said Acting Inspector in
Charge Davis. âCorruption and bribery schemes such as this involving international corporations and conspirators are not victimless crimes.
This type of conduct can damage competitive domestic and international markets, and cause immeasurable economic losses both here in the
United States and around the world. Anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this should know they will not go undetected and will be
held accountable, regardless of where they are. The collaborative investigative work on this case conducted by Postal Inspectors and our
domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect the United States and the international marketplace.â

âThe allegations outlined today exemplify how a small group of individuals, who knowingly engage in illegal payments in an attempt to advance
businesses dealings, create an uneven global marketplace,â said Acting Assistant Director Hacker. âThe FBI with our partners continues to work
these important cases in order to remove the notion that bribery, through backroom deals, is an acceptable way of doing business. This
investigation demonstrates the importance of international cooperation amongst law enforcement in combatting fraud and money laundering
ona global basis.â

âTodayâs charges serve as a reminder of the important role the FBI plays in rooting out international corruption,â said FBI Special Agent in
Charge DeSarno. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to perpetrate a similar scheme
that the FBI will work with global partners in its mission to detect and prevent corrupt business practices, and we will continue to hold those who
attempt to take advantage of international markets accountable.â

According to the superseding indictment, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE. International Ltd. (Gravitas),
former Rolls-Royce employees and executives, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing
business to Rolls-Royce Energy Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based global
manufacturer and distributor of power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The superseding indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor),
including Martirossian and Leshkov, devised and executed a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, whereby Rolls-Royce would
pay kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees and bribes to at least one foreign official in Kazakhstan, and disguise these payments as
commissions to Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the superseding indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the
Technical Advisor purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The superseding indictment
further alleges that after AGP awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made
commission payments to Gravitas, and Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees,
including Leshkov and Martirossian, knowing that a portion of that money would be shared with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt
agreement.

The charges announced today follow the Jan. 17, 2017 announcement of a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with Rolls-Royce plc and a
more than $800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice, U.K., and Brazilian authorities
related to the corrupt conduct. The charges also follow upon the Nov. 7, 2017 announcement, concerning Rolls-Royce former executives and
employees James Finley, Keith Barnett and Louis Zuurhout, and Technical Advisor employee Andreas Kohler, each of whom have entered guilty
pleas in connection with their respective roles in the bribery scheme. The DPA acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including
with the Departmentâs investigation into individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Kevin
R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Michael Marous and Jessica Kim of the
Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the Department to reach
simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria, the Bahamas, Germany, the
Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland and Turkey.

Businessman Indicted for Conspiring to Bribe Senior Government Officials of the Republic of Haiti

A businessman was charged in a superseding indictment filed today for his alleged participation in a scheme to bribe senior government
officials of the Republic of Haiti in connection with a planned $84 million port development project, and to launder funds in order to promote the
bribery. An alleged co-conspirator was previously charged in the original indictment.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling of the District of
Massachusetts, Assistant Director Christopher Hacker of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Harold M. Shaw of
the FBIâs Boston Field Office made the announcement.

Roger Richard Boncy, 74, a dual U.S. and Haitian citizen who resides in Madrid, Spain, was charged in a superseding indictment filed in the
District of Massachusetts with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Travel Act, one count of
violating the Travel Act and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The superseding indictment also charges Boncyâs co-
conspirator, Joseph Baptiste, DDS, 66, of Fulton, Maryland, with the same crimes. Baptiste was originally charged by indictment in this case in
October 2017. Baptisteâs trial is scheduled to begin on Dec. 3, in the District of Massachusetts in Boston.

The superseding indictment alleges that Boncy and Baptiste solicited bribes from undercover agents posing as potential investors in connection
with a proposed project to develop a port in the MÃ©le St. Nicolas area of Haiti. The proposed project was expected to cost approximately $84
million and was to involve the construction of multiple cement factories, a shipping-vessel recycling station, an international transshipment
station with numerous slips for shipping vessels, a power plant, a petroleum depot and tourist facilities.

During a recorded meeting at a Boston-area hotel, Boncy and Baptiste allegedly told the agents that, in order to secure Haitian government
approval of the project, they would funnel the payments to Haitian officials through a non-profit entity that Baptiste controlled, which was based
in Maryland and purported to help impoverished residents of Haiti. In intercepted telephone calls, Boncy and Baptiste also allegedly discussed
bribing an aide to a high-level elected official in Haiti with a job on the port development project, in exchange for the aideâs help in obtaining the
elected officialâs authorization for the project.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The FBI's Boston Field Office and International Corruption Unit investigated the case. Trial Attorney Elina A. Rubin-Smith of the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kriss Basil of the District of Massachusetts are prosecuting the case.

Texas Businessman Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charges in Connection with Venezuela
Bribery Scheme

A former procurement officer of Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), pleaded
guilty today for his role in an international money laundering scheme involving bribes paid by the owners of U.S.-based companies to
Venezeulan government officials in exchange for securing additional business with PDVSA and payment priority on outstanding invoices.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigationsâ
(HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Ivan Alexis Guedez (Guedez), 47, of Katy, Texas, pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christina A. Bryan of the Southern District of Texas
in Houston to one count of conspiracy to launder money. Guedez is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 20, 2019 by U.S. District Judge Gray H.
Miller of the Southern District of Texas.

According to admissions made in connection with Guedezâs plea, Guedez agreed with other PDVSA officials and businessmen who were
employed by a Miami-based PDVSA supplier that, in exchange for bribe payments, Guedez and the other PDVSA officials would direct PDVSA
business toward the supplier. The co-conspirators who were employed by the PDVSA supplier also received kickbacks. Guedez and his co-
conspirators concealed the corrupt payments by, among other things, communicating using fictitious email addresses, creating false invoices to
justify the payments, and directing the bribe payments to a Swiss account in the name of a shell company before being disbursed to the co-
conspirators.

As part of his plea agreement, Guedez has agreed to forfeit the proceeds of his criminal activity.

Guedez becomes the latest individual to plead guilty as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA.
Including Guedez, the Justice Department has announced the guilty pleas of a total of 15 individuals in connection with the investigation.

HSI Houston is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from HSI Boston and Madrid, as well as from IRS Criminal Investigation.
Trial Attorneys Jeremy R. Sanders, Sarah E. Edwards and Sonali Patel of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys John
Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the
Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

Embraer Agrees to Pay More than $107 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Charges

Parallel Resolutions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian Authorities Equaling $97 Million in Disgorgement Also
Announced Today

Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer S.A. (Embraer) entered into a resolution to resolve criminal charges and agreed to pay a penalty of
more than $107 million in connection with schemes involving the bribery of government officials in the Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia and
Mozambique, and to pay millions more in falsely recorded payments in India via a sham agency agreement.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Assistant Special Agent in Charge William J.
Maddalena of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

âEmbraer paid millions of dollars in bribes to win government aircraft contracts in three different continents,â said Assistant Attorney General
Caldwell. âBut this prosecution shows that the Criminal Division will hold accountable those who treat corruption as a mere cost of doing
business. Between U.S., Brazilian and Saudi authorities, bribe payers and bribe takers alike have been brought to justice for their wrongdoing.â

âEmbraer tried to bribe their way into several profitable aircraft contracts around the world,â said Assistant Special Agent in Charge Maddalena.
âInstead of reaping a nice profit, their criminal conduct earned the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer a substantial penalty that more than wiped
out their gains from these contracts. Crime does not pay!â

According to the companyâs admissions, Embraer executives and employees paid bribes to government officials and falsified books and records
in connection with aircraft sales to foreign governments and state-owned entities in multiple countries. In 2008, Embraer paid $3.52 million to
an influential government official in the Dominican Republic via a false agency agreement to secure a contract to sell the Dominican Air Force
eight military aircraft for approximately $92 million. In 2010, Embraer paid $1.65 million to an official at a Saudi Arabian state-owned and -
controlled company via a false agency agreement to secure that instrumentalityâs agreement to purchase three aircraft from Embraer for
approximately $93 million. In 2008, Embraer paid $800,000 via a false agency agreement with an intermediary designated by a high-level
official at Mozambiqueâs state-owned commercial airline, Linhas AÃ©reas de Mocambique S.A. (LAM), to secure LAMâs agreement to purchase two
aircraft from Embraer for approximately $65 million. In 2009, Embraer paid an agent $5.76 million pursuant to a false agency agreement with a
shell company in connection with a contract it secured to sell the Indian Air Force three aircraft for approximately $208 million.

In total, Embraer earned profits of nearly $84 million on the foregoing aircraft sales.

Embraer entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to resolve the case. As part of the DPA, Embraer admitted to its
involvement in a conspiracy to violate the FCPAâs anti-bribery and books and records provisions and to its willful failure to implement an
adequate system of internal accounting controls. Embraer agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $107,285,090; continue to cooperate with the
department's investigation; enhance its compliance program; implement a more adequate system of internal accounting controls; and retain an
independent corporate compliance monitor for a term of three years.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that Embraer did not voluntarily
disclose the FCPA violations, but did cooperate with the department's investigation after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) served
it with a subpoena. After Embraer began cooperating, it did so fully and disclosed all relevant, non-privileged facts known to it, including about
individuals involved in the misconduct. Embraer did not, however, engage in full remediation. It disciplined a number of company employees
and executives engaged in the misconduct, but did not discipline a senior executive who was aware of bribery discussions in emails in 2004 and
had oversight responsibility for the employees engaged in those discussions. As a result, the criminal penalty in this case is 20 percent below
the bottom of the applicable range under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a discount that reflects Embraerâs full cooperation but incomplete
remediation.

In related matters, Embraer reached settlements with both the SEC and Brazilian authorities. Embraer reached a settlement with the SEC,
under which it agreed to pay $83.8 million in disgorgement and $14.4 million in prejudgment interest. The SEC has agreed to credit the
disgorgement that Embraer pays to Brazilian authorities. Embraer also reached a settlement with Brazilian authorities under which it agreed to
pay $20 million in disgorgement. With the cooperation of U.S. authorities, Brazilian authorities have charged 11 individuals for their alleged
involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in the Dominican Republic. Saudi Arabian authorities have charged two individuals for their alleged
involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in Saudi Arabia.

The FBIâs Miami Field Office investigated the case. Senior Trial Attorney Jason Linder and Trial Attorney John-Alex Romano of the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section prosecuted the case.

The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter. Authorities in Brazil, the Dominican Republic
and South Africa also provided assistance and cooperation. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided assistance
during the investigation.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

Former Embraer Sales Executive Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Related Charges

A former sales executive of Embraer S.A. (Embraer), a Brazilian-based manufacturer of aircraft, pleaded guilty today in connection with a
scheme to pay bribes to a high-level foreign government official in exchange for assistance in securing Embraerâs sale of aircraft to Saudi
Arabiaâs national oil company.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the Southern
District of New York, Assistant Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Robert F.
Lasky of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Colin Steven, 61, a U.K. citizen residing in the United Arab Emirates, was charged by information filed today in the Southern District of New York
with one count of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, one count of wire fraud, one
count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of making a
false statement. Steven pleaded guilty to all of those counts before U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan of the Southern District of New York. A
sentencing date has not been scheduled yet. The Court set a control date of June 21, 2018.

As part of his plea, Steven, a former vice president of sales & marketing in Embraerâs Executive Jets Division, admitted that he engaged ina
scheme to have Embraer pay bribes to a foreign official in exchange for assistance in getting an aircraft sales contract with favorable terms
awarded to Embraer; retained a kickback as part of the scheme; and lied to law enforcement officials about his kickback.

Steven consented to the filing of the information, which alleged that Embraer was in negotiations with Saudi Arabiaâs national oil company over
a potential aircraft sale when Steven and the foreign official devised an arrangement whereby the foreign official would guarantee that Embraer
would win a contract and that the contract would involve new rather than used aircraft in exchange for approximately $1.5 million in bribe
payments. In early 2010, Saudi Arabiaâs national oil company awarded Embraer a contract for three new aircraft, valued at approximately $93
million. The information further alleged that he arranged to disguise the bribes as commissions to a South African company that was owned in
part by Steven's personal friends. The South African company transferred the bulk of the bribe proceeds to the foreign officialâs intermediary
but, at Stevenâs direction, paid a portion of the bribe proceeds to Steven.

In pleading guilty, Steven admitted that he executed, and conspired with others to execute, the bribery and kickback schemes; laundered and
conspired to launder the proceeds of those schemes through the South African company and lied to U.S. law enforcement about the kickback.

The guilty plea entered today follows the execution in October 2016 of a deferred prosecution agreement between the Department and
Embraer, under which Embraer agreed to pay a $107 million penalty to the Department as part of a $205 million global resolution to
investigations by the Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Brazilian authorities related to corrupt conduct in several
countries, including Saudi Arabia. The agreement acknowledged Embraerâs cooperation with the investigations. With the cooperation of U.S.
authorities, Brazilian authorities have charged 11 individuals for their alleged involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in the Dominican Republic.
Saudi Arabian authorities have charged two individuals for their alleged involvement in Embraerâs misconduct in Saudi Arabia.

The FBI's International Corruption Squads, based in Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California, investigated the case. Trial Attorneys John-Alex
Romano and Nikhila Raj and Assistant Chief David Johnson of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Cooper
of the Southern District of New York, are prosecuting the case. The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and assistance provided by the
SEC in this matter.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The Department also appreciates the
cooperation and assistance provided by authorities in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, South Africa and Switzerland in this matter.

In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign
corruption.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

Former Senior Alstom Executive Sentenced to Prison for Role in Money Laundering Scheme to
Promote Foreign Bribery

A former senior executive with Alstom S.A. (Alstom), a French power and transportation company, was sentenced in federal court in New Haven,
Connecticut, to 15 months in prison today for his role in a multi-year, multimillion-dollar money laundering scheme designed to promote
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of
Connecticut and Assistant Director in Charge Paul D. Delacout of the FBIâs Los Angeles Office made the announcement.

Lawrence Hoskins, 69, was sentenced on charges of conspiracy and money laundering, following his conviction in November 2019, after a one-
week jury trial before U.S. District Judge Janet Bond Arterton, who imposed todayâs sentence. In addition to his prison term, Hoskins was fined
$30,000.

According to the evidence presented at trial, Hoskins was a senior vice president for Alstomâs International Network, who engaged ina
conspiracy to promote the payment of bribes to officials in Indonesia in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as
the Tarahan project, for Alstom Power Inc. of Connecticut and its consortium partner, Marubeni Corporation, to provide power-related services
for the citizens of Indonesia. The officials in Indonesia included a high-ranking member of the Indonesian Parliament and the President of
Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity company in Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, Hoskins and his
co-conspirators retained two consultants purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of Alstom Power Inc., in connection with
the Tarahan project. The primary purpose of hiring the consultants was to conceal the bribes to Indonesian officials, the evidence showed.

The first consultant retained by Hoskins and other members of the conspiracy received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his Maryland bank
account to be used to bribe the member of Parliament, the evidence showed. The consultant then transferred the bribe money to a bank
account in Indonesia for the benefit of the official. According to emails admitted at trial, Hoskins and other co-conspirators discussed in detail
the use of the first consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over
the Tarahan project, including referring to him as a âcashier.â

The trial evidence further showed that, in the fall of 2003, Hoskins and his co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was not
effectively bribing key officials at PLN, who expressed concerns that the first consultant was just going to give them âpocket moneyâ and
âdisappearâ after Alstom Power Inc. won the project. As a result, the co-conspirators retained a second consultant to more effectively bribe PLN
officials. Evidence revealed that Hoskins and his co-conspirators pressed Alstom Power Inc. to front-load the second consultantâs terms of
payment in order to âget the right influenceâ due to upcoming elections. Hoskins and his co-conspirators were successful in securing the
Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials.

The FBI's Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the FBIâs Meriden, Connecticut, Resident Agency. The
department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Indonesia, Switzerland's Office of the
Attorney General and the United Kingdom, as well as authorities in France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan.

Senior Deputy Chief Daniel S. Kahn and Assistant Chief Lorinda Laryea of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David
E. Novick of the District of Connecticut are prosecuting the case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

Five Individuals Charged in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving Rolls-Royce Plc and Its U.S.
Subsidiary

Charges were unsealed today against two former executives of Rolls-Royce plc and its subsidiaries (Rolls-Royce), a former Rolls-Royce
employee, a former intermediary for Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan and an executive of an international engineering consulting firm - all for their
alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials for the benefit of a U.S.-based Rolls-Royce subsidiary, including
to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Central Asia to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Inspector in Charge Regina Faulkerson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs
Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece residing in Turkey, was charged by an indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio on Oct. 12, and
unsealed today, with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to launder money,
seven counts of violating the FCPA and 10 counts of money laundering. Contoguris is believed to be outside of the United States. James Finley,
66, a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in Taiwan, pleaded guilty on July 28, before Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of the Southern
District of Ohio, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout, 53, of the
Netherlands; Andreas Kohler, 53, of Austria; and Keith Barnett, 48, of Houston, Texas, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate
the FCPA before Chief Judge Sargus on June 13; June 6; and Dec. 20, 2016, respectively.

âThe charges announced today against executives, employees, and third parties affiliated with Rolls-Royce, is another example of the Criminal
Divisionâs commitment to holding individuals - and not just corporations - accountable for violating the FCPA,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Blanco. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agents - working closely with their counterparts in Brazil and at the
United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, among others - these defendants, many of whom reside overseas, will face justice in this case, which
represents another important step towards leveling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.â

âThe charges unsealed today reflect the determination and ability of the United States to investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in
foreign corrupt business practices, regardless of how sophisticated or far-flung the scheme may be,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âWe can and
will follow the evidence wherever it leads - from Columbus to Kazakhstan and beyond.â

âThis type of sophisticated fraud scheme can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world,â said Inspector in
Charge Faulkerson. âAnyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable. The
U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases. The collaborative
investigative work conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect
the United States and the international marketplace.â

âTodayâs indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own
personal gain,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to
perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the
global marketplace.â

âTodayâs charges demonstrate the immense capabilities of the FBIâs Washington Field Office international corruption program and the global
impact of the anti-corruption program,â said Assistant Director in Charge Vale. âThe FBI is committed to holding accountable those who disrupt
the level playing field to which companies in the United States and around the world are entitled.â

According to the indictment and informations unsealed today, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE.
International Ltd. (Gravitas); Finley, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce; Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-
Royce; Zuurhout, a former energy sales employee at Rolls-Royce; and Kohler, a managing director at an international engineering and
consulting firm, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy
Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based manufacturer and distributor of
power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including
Kohler, devised a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett and Finley, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay
kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees, and bribes to at least one foreign official, and disguise these payments as commissions to
Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The indictment further alleges that after AGP
awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and
Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees knowing that they would share that
money with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy, going as far back as approximately 1999
and continuing into 2013, to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials
in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and
instrumentalities across the globe.

The charges announced today follow the announcement on Jan. 17, of a deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than
$800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice and U.K. and Brazilian authorities related
to the corrupt conduct. The agreement acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into
individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI
formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial
Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder and Assistant Chief Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Michael J. Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the
Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Five Former Venezuelan Government Officials Charged in Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Foreign Bribery

Charges were unsealed today against five former Venezuelan government officials for their alleged participation in an international money
laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy
company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Two of the five defendants are also charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Four of the defendants, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 50; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 50; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39, were arrested in Spain in October 2017 by Spanish authorities on arrest
warrants based on a 20-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Aug. 23, 2017. Cesar Rincon was extradited from Spain
on Feb. 9, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge MJ Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas. De Leon,
Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spanish custody pending extradition. A fifth defendant, Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33, remains at large.
All five defendants are citizens of Venezuela; De Leon is also a U.S. citizen.

De Leon, Villalobos, Reiter and Isturiz are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Cesar Rincon is charged
with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each of the defendants is charged with one or more counts of money laundering,
as follows: De Leon, Cesar Rincon and Reiter, four counts each; Villalobos, one count; and Isturiz, five counts. De Leon and Villalobos are also
each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âCorruption threatens economic and political stability, and victimizes ordinary law-abiding people by diverting public funds into the pockets of
corrupt officials and bribe payers,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe charges announced today demonstrate our
commitment to fighting corruption at its source and to prosecuting those who allegedly launder their illicit gains through American financial
institutions and real estate. Through cases like this, we are sending a strong message to corrupt foreign officials: if you launder your ill-gotten
gains through the United States, you will be prosecuted.â

âEffective deterrence of corruption requires prosecution of culpable individuals, wherever those individuals are located,â said U.S. Attorney
Patrick. âWe will continue to enforce the FCPA against those that avail themselves of the privileges of the American marketplace.â

âThis case is an example of what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to thwart complex cross-
border crimesâ said Special Agent in Charge Dawson. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would
participate in illegal practices.

The indictment alleges that the five defendants, all of whom were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other
Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, were known as the âmanagement teamâ and wielded significant influence within PDVSA.
According to the indictment, the management team conspired with each other and others to solicit several PDVSA vendors, including vendors
who were residents of the United States, and who owned and controlled businesses incorporated and based in the United States, for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business. The indictment further alleges that
the co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions,
including to, from or through bank accounts in the United States, and, in some instances, laundered the bribe proceeds in the form of real
estate transactions and other investments in the United States.

According to the indictment, two PDVSA vendors, Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, sent over $27 million in bribe payments to an account in Switzerland for
which De Leon was a beneficial owner and De Leon and Villalobos were authorized signers. The indictment alleges that those funds were later
transferred to other accounts in Switzerland. Both Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to
FCPA charges in connection with a scheme to bribe PDVSA officials. According to admissions made in connection with their pleas, Roberto
Rincon and Shiera paid bribes and provided other things of value to PDVSA officials to ensure that their companies were placed on PDVSA
bidding panels and ensure that they were given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding
invoices. Roberto Rincon and Shiera are currently awaiting sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 15 individuals, 10 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys
Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District
of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Gabonese-French Dual Citizen Sentenced to 24 Months Imprisonment for Bribing African Officials

A dual citizen of Gabon and France was sentenced to 24 months in prison for his role in a conspiracy to pay bribes to senior government officials
across Africa, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde of the
Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Acting Special Agent in
Charge Ronald L. Whitsett of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl)âs New York office made the announcement.

Samuel Mebiame, 43, who resided in Paris prior to his arrest, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Eastern District of
New York. Mebiame pleaded guilty on Dec. 9, 2016, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

According to admissions made at his plea hearing, Mebiame formed a conspiracy to provide improper benefits to government officials in
multiple countries in Africa. Mebiame admitted that the improper benefits he provided were intended to influence the performance of official
governmental duties, and that he took steps to further the conspiracy while physically in New York. Based on court documents, Mebiame
worked as a âfixerâ on behalf of a joint venture company owned by New-York-based hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (Och-
Ziff) and its business partner, a Turks and Caicos Islands-registered corporate entity controlled by a co-conspirator. In that role, Mebiame
traveled extensively across Africa, Europe and the U.S. and routinely made bribe payments to senior government officials in Africa. Mebaimeâs
plea documents indicated that at least five senior officials in three countries, Niger, Chad and Guinea, received corrupt payments and various
illicit benefits from Mebiame. The officials, each of whom could influence the award of mining, oil and mineral concessions in their countries,
received either cash payments, luxury vehicles or extravagant travel including the private rental of an Airbus jet. The bribes paid by Mebiame to
the officials were often masked through additional intermediaries or attorneys.

According to court documents, in Niger, Mebiame paid more than $3 million in bribes to a high-ranking government official both directly and
through intermediary agents who were selected by the Nigerien official. Mebiame also made payments for luxury cars for that foreign official
and directed a $100,000 donation to a charity run by a government official. In return, Mebiame obtained licenses for uranium concessions for
the joint venture from the government of Niger. Similarly, in Chad, Mebiame bribed a high-ranking government official with cash payments and
luxury foreign travel for the official and the officialâs wife. In return, Mebiame obtained uranium concessions for the joint venture, including
rights to an asset which had been stripped by the Chadian government, at Mebiameâs urging, from a French-owned company. In Guinea, during
a time when the conspirators were seeking to establish a state-owned mining company there, Mebiame made corrupt payments to gain special
access to senior Guinean government officials. Mebiame provided the officials with cash and other benefits, including an S-Class Mercedes Benz
vehicle and the use of private planes, in exchange for special access and confidential information.

Mebiameâs plea documents indicate that Mebiame repeatedly traveled to the United States between 2007 and 2015, the period of the criminal
acts, and used facilities in both New York and Florida to further the conspiracy. Among other activities undertaken by Mebiame cited in court
papers, he met with co-conspirators in New York, received funds from co-conspirators to U.S. bank accounts he controlled, and had telephone
calls and email correspondence about the scheme.

Following Mebiameâs arrest in Brooklyn last August, as part of the governmentâs broader investigation, Och-Ziff was charged in September 2016
with violations of the FCPAâs anti-bribery, books and records, and accounting controls provisions for conduct in Libya and the Democratic
Republic of Congo, and conduct in Chad and Niger connected to Mebiame and his co-conspiratorsâ conduct. Och-Ziff entered into a deferred
prosecution agreement in connection with those charges. An Och-Ziff subsidiary company, OZ Africa Management GP LLC pleaded guilty to a
one-count criminal information related to the payment of extensive bribes in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The FBI's New York Field Office and IRS-Cl New York investigated the case. Trial Attorney James P. McDonald and Assistant Chief Leo R. Tsao of
the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys James P. Loonam, Jonathan P. Lax and David Pitluck of the Eastern District of

Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Pleads Guilty to Bribing
Official at European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The former owner and president of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (the Chestnut Group) pleaded guilty
today to bribing an official at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and Special Agent in Charge William F. Sweeney of the FBI's Philadelphia Division made the announcement.

Dmitrij Harder, 43, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, a U.S. legal permanent resident, pleaded guilty to two counts of violating the FCPA
before U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Sentencing is scheduled for July 21, 2016.

According to admissions made in connection with Harderâs plea, the EBRD was a multilateral development bank headquartered in London that
was owned by more than 60 sovereign nations and provided financing for development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern
Europe. Harder admitted that between 2007 and 2009, he engaged in a scheme to pay approximately $3.5 million in bribes to an EBRD official
to corruptly influence the officialâs actions on applications for EBRD financing submitted by the Chestnut Groupâs clients and to influence the
official to direct business to the Chestnut Group.

The EBRD ultimately approved applications for financing from two of the Chestnut Groupâs corporate clients; the first resulted in the EBRD
providing an $85 million investment and a 90 million Euro loan, while the second resulted in a $40 million investment and a $60 million
convertible loan, according to the plea. Harder admitted that the Chestnut Group earned approximately $8 million in âsuccess feesâ as a result
of the EBRDâs approval of these two applications.

In a related action, the EBRD official, Andrey Ryjenko, and his sister, Tatjana Sanderson, have been charged by the United Kingdomâs Crown
Prosecution Service and are pending trial. A status conference in that matter is set for June 8, 2016.

The FBI's Philadelphia Division is investigating the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and
Senior Trial Attorney Jason Linder of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section are prosecuting the case. The City of London Policeâs Overseas Anti
Corruption Unit and the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance. Germany, Jersey and Guernsey also provided
assistance in this matter.

Retired U.S. Army Colonel Indicted for Conspiring to Bribe Senior Government Officials of the
Republic of Haiti

A retired U.S. Army colonel was charged in an indictment filed today for his alleged role in a foreign bribery and money laundering scheme in
connection with a planned $84 million port development project in Haiti.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney William D. Weinreb of
the District of Massachusetts, Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge
Harold M. Shaw of the FBI's Boston Field Office made the announcement.

Joseph Baptiste, 64, of Fulton, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Travel
Act, one count of violating the Travel Act and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in an indictment filed in the District of
Massachusetts.

The indictment alleges that Baptiste solicited bribes from undercover FBI agents in Boston who posed as potential investors in connection with a
proposed project to develop a port in the Moles Saint Nicolas area of Haiti. According to the indictment, the proposed project was expected to
cost approximately $84 million, and was to involve the construction of a cement factory in its first phase. The indictment alleges that during a
recorded meeting at a Boston-area hotel, Baptiste told the agents that he would funnel the payments to Haitian officials through a non-profit
entity that he controlled â which was based in Maryland and purported to help impoverished residents of Haiti â in order to secure government
approval of the project.

The indictment further alleges that in telephone calls Baptiste discussed bribing an aide to a senior Haitian official by giving him a job on the
port development project after he left his position. It further alleges that although Baptiste ultimately used for personal purposes approximately
$50,000 that he received from the undercover agents for the payment of bribes to Haitian officials â money that was wired at Baptisteâs
direction to a non-profit organization he controls â he intended to seek additional money from the undercover agents to use for future bribe
payments in connection with the port project.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

This case was investigated by the FBI. Trial Attorney Kevin R. Gingras of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Stephen E. Frank of the District of Massachusetts are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice

Chairman of Macau Real Estate Development Company Sentenced to Prison for Role in Scheme to
Bribe United Nations Ambassadors to Build A Multi-Billion Dollar Conference Center

The chairman of a real estate development company was sentenced today to 48 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his
role in a scheme to bribe United Nations ambassadors to obtain support to build a conference center in Macau that would host, among other
events, the annual United Nations Global South-South Development Expo.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the
Southern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Special Agent in Charge
James D. Robnett of the IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) New York Field Office made the announcement.

Ng Lap Seng, aka âDavid Ng,â 69, of Macau, China, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick of the Southern District of New
York. In addition to his prison sentence, Judge Broderick ordered Ng to pay a $1 million fine and $302, 977 in restitution to the United Nations.
He also ordered a forfeiture money judgment of $1.5 million in forfeiture. Ng must report to the U.S. Marshals Service by July 10 to start his
prison sentence. Ng was convicted on July 27, 2017, after a five-week trial of two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, one
count of paying bribes and gratuities, one count of money laundering and two counts of conspiracy.

âCorruption at any level of government undermines the rule of law and cannot be tolerated,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan.
âBut corruption is especially corrosive when it occurs at an international body like the United Nations. By paying bribes to two U.N.
ambassadors to advance his interest in obtaining formal support for the Macau conference center project, Ng Lap Seng tried to manipulate the
functions of the United Nations. The sentence handed down today demonstrates that those who engage in corruption will pay a heavy price
and serves as a reminder that no one stands above the law.â

âBillionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations in pursuit of a multibillion-dollar real estate deal in Macau,â said U.S.
Attorney Berman. âNg exploited a center for international diplomacy as an instrument for his greedy intentions. This Office is committed to
policing official corruption wherever it may be found.â

âGaining the upper hand in a business venture by engaging in corrupt practices is bribery in its purest form. Today, Ng Lap Seng has learned
the price he will have to pay for his actions,â said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. â| commend the investigators and prosecutors who
continue to work together at home and abroad to vigorously enforce the law within the confines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âNo matter if money is funneled through New York corporations or transferred offshore, IRS-Cl is always ready to follow the money,â said IRS-Cl
Special Agent-in-Charge Robnett. âTodayâs sentencing shows that IRS-Cl is committed to rooting out public corruption by investigating
individuals who misuse their positions of public trust for personal financial gain.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a
former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to
the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who
worked with Ng and others and previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the United States, Ng orchestrated a scheme with the
principal objective of obtaining the formal support of the UN for a multi-billion dollar facility that Ng hoped to build in Macau using the Sun Kian
Ip Group (the âMacau Conference Centerâ). Ng wanted the Macau Conference Center to serve as a location for meetings, discussions, forums,
and other events associated with the UN. In particular, he wanted it to serve as the permanent home of the annual âGlobal South-South
Development Expo,â which is run by the UN Office for South-South Cooperation, and is hosted in a different country or city every year.

The trial evidence showed that Ng bribed Ambassador Ashe and Ambassador Lorenzo (together, the âAmbassadorsâ) in exchange for their
agreement to use their official positions to advance Ngâs interest in obtaining formal UN support for the Macau Conference Center. As the
evidence demonstrated at trial, Ng paid the Ambassadors in a variety of forms. For example, Ng appointed Ambassador Lorenzo as the
President of South-South News, a New York-based organization â funded by Ng â which described itself as a media platform dedicated to
advancing the implementation of the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a set of philanthropic goals. Ng provided bribe payments to
Ambassador Lorenzo through South-South News by transmitting payments from Macau to a company in the Dominican Republic affiliated with
Ambassador Lorenzoâs brother (the âDominican Companyâ). Through South-South News, Ng also made payments to Ambassador Ashe,
including to Ambassador Asheâs wife, who was paid in her capacity as a âconsultantâ to South-South News, and to an account that Ambassador
Ashe had established, purportedly to raise money for his role as President of UNGA.

According to the trial evidence, one of the actions that the Ambassadors took in exchange for bribe payments, to advance Ngâs objectives, was
to submit an official document to the then-UN Secretary-General in support of the Macau Conference Center (the âUN Documentâ). The UN
Document claimed that there was a need to build the Macau Conference Center to support the UNâs global development goals. Ambassador
Ashe, aided by Ambassador Lorenzo, initially submitted the UN Document to the UNGA in or about late February 2012. More than a year later,
at Ngâs behest, the Ambassadors revised the UN Document to refer specifically to Ngâs company, the Macau Real Estate Development
Company, as a partner in the Macau Conference Center project. The UN Document requested that the Secretary-General circulate the UN
Document âas a document of the 66"" session of the General Assembly,â under a specific item of the official UNGA agenda. The Secretary-
General followed this request, thereby making the UN Document an official part of the UNGA record.

Five other defendants have been charged in this matter. Lorenzo and Heidi Hong Piao pleaded guilty to various charges, including bribery, and
are awaiting sentencing. Jeff C. Yin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and was sentenced to seven months in prison.
Shiwei Yan pleaded guilty to bribery and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Co-defendant Ashe passed away in 2016 and the charges
against him were dismissed.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-Cl. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance.
Assistant Chief David A. Last of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Janis M. Echenberg, and
Douglas S. Zolkind of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Pleads Guilty to Bribing
Official at European Bank for Reconstruction and Development

The former owner and president of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (the Chestnut Group) pleaded guilty
today to bribing an official at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern

Dmitrij Harder, 43, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, a U.S. legal permanent resident, pleaded guilty to two counts of violating the FCPA

Telia Company AB and Its Uzbek Subsidiary Enter Into a Global Foreign Bribery Resolution of
More Than $965 Million for Corrupt Payments in Uzbekistan

Companies Agree to Coordinated Resolution between the Department of Justice, U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands Representing the Second Major Resolution Involving
Corruption by Telecom Companies in Uzbekistan

Stockholm-based Telia Company AB, an international telecommunications company that was formerly an issuer of publicly traded securities in
the U.S., and its Uzbek subsidiary, Coscom LLC, entered into a global foreign bribery resolution and agreed to pay a combined total penalty of
more than $965 million to resolve charges arising out of a scheme to pay bribes in Uzbekistan.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the
Southern District of New York, Chief Don Fort of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) and Special Agent in Charge Patrick J.
Lechleitner of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) Washington, D.C., Field Office made the
announcement.

âThis resolution underscores the Departmentâs continued and unwavering commitment to robust FCPA and white-collar criminal enforcement. It
also demonstrates the Departmentâs cooperative posture with its foreign counterparts to stamp out international corruption and to reach fair,
appropriate and coordinated resolutions,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco. âForeign and domestic companies that pay bribes put
honest companies at a disadvantage and distort the free and fair market and the rule of law. Todayâs resolution reflects the significant efforts
of law enforcement, the Criminal Division and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York to bring such companies to justice,
and to maintain a competitive and level playing field for companies to do business, create jobs and thrive.â

âToday, we announce one of the largest criminal corporate bribery and corruption resolutions ever, with penalties totaling just under a billion
dollars,â said Acting U.S. Attorney Kim. âSwedish telecom company Telia and its Uzbek subsidiary Coscom have admitted to paying, over many
years, more than $331 million in bribes to an Uzbek government official. Telia, whose securities traded publicly in New York, corruptly built a
lucrative telecommunications business in Uzbekistan, using bribe payments wired around the world through accounts here in New York City. If
your securities trade on our exchanges and you use our banks to move ill-gotten money, then you have to abide by our countryâs laws. Telia
and Coscom refused to do so, and they have been held accountable in Manhattan federal court today.â

âToday marks the second resolution of proceedings against corporate entities who have engaged in a global bribery scheme of government
officials,â said Chief Fort. âIt also further demonstrates the dedication we have to identifying illegal financial transactions being used for bribery
in the international community. It is important that the global economy remain on a fair playing field and IRS-CI will remain committed in our
efforts to dismantle these kinds of corrupt financial schemes.â

âToday's resolution marks a win against a foreign corruption scheme where millions of dollars in bribery funds were paid to Uzbekistan officials
and laundered through the U.S. financial system.â said Special Agent in Charge Lechleitner. âHSI, working hand in hand with our partners at IRS
Criminal Investigation, leveled the playing field for publicly traded companies by exposing these corrupt practices and helped the U.S.
government collect nearly $275 million in criminal penaltiesâ

Telia entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with a criminal information filed today in the Southern District of New York
charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The case is assigned
to U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels. In addition, Coscom pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Judge Daniels on a one-count criminal
information charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to its agreement with the
Department, Telia agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $274,603,972 to the U.S., including a $500,000 criminal fine and $40 million in
criminal forfeiture that Telia agreed to pay on behalf of Coscom. Telia also agreed to implement rigorous internal controls and cooperate fully
with the Departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Prosecution Service of the Netherlands (Openbaar Ministrie, or OM)
announced separate settlements with Telia in connection with related proceedings. Under the terms of its resolution with the SEC, Telia agreed
to a total of $457,169,977 in disgorgement of profits and prejudgment interest, and the SEC agreed to credit any disgorged profits that Telia
pays to the Swedish Prosecution Authority (SPA) or OM, up to half of the total. Telia agreed to pay the OM a criminal penalty of $274,000,000
for a total criminal penalty of $548,603,972, and a total resolution amount of more than $1 billion. The Department of Justice agreed to credit
the criminal penalty paid to the OM as part of its agreement with the company. The SEC agreed to credit the $40 million in forfeiture paid to
the Department as part of its agreement with the company. Thus, the combined total amount of criminal and regulatory penalties paid by Telia
and Coscom to the U.S., Dutch, and Swedish authorities will be $965,773,949.

According to the companiesâ admissions, Telia and Coscom, through various managers and employees within Telia, Coscom and affiliated
entities, paid approximately $331 million in bribes to an Uzbek government official, who was a close relative of a high-ranking government
official and had influence over the Uzbek governmental body that regulated the telecom industry. The companies structured and concealed the
bribes through various payments including to a shell company that certain Telia and Coscom management knew was beneficially owned by the
foreign official. The bribes were paid on multiple occasions between approximately 2007 and 2010, so that Telia could enter the Uzbek market
and Coscom could gain valuable telecom assets and continue operating in Uzbekistan. Certain Telia and Coscom management also
contemplated structuring an additional bribe payment in late 2012, after Swedish media began reporting about Teliaâs corrupt payments in
Uzbekistan, Swedish authorities began a criminal investigation and Telia opened an internal investigation.

A number of significant factors contributed to the Departmentâs criminal resolution with the companies. Among these, the companies received
significant credit for their extensive remedial measures and cooperation with the Departmentâs investigation. Specifically, the criminal penalty
reflects a 25 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range. However, the companies did not receive more
significant mitigation credit, either in the penalty or the form of resolution, because the companies did not voluntarily self-disclose their
misconduct to the Department.

The resolution, reached in coordination with the SEC and authorities in the Netherlands, marks the second such resolution by a major
international telecommunciations provider for bribery in Uzbekistan. On Feb. 18, 2016, Amsterdam-based VimpelCom Limited and its Uzbek
subsidiary, Unitel LLC, also entered into resolutions with the Department of Justice and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $114
million in bribery payments to the same Uzbek government official between 2006 and 2012. The investigation has thus far yielded a combined
total of over $1.76 billion in global fines and disgorgement, including over $500 million in criminal penalties to the Department of Justice. In
related actions, the Department has also filed civil complaints seeking the forfeiture of more than $850 million held in bank accounts in
Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, which constitute bribe payments made by VimpelCom, Telia and a third telecommunications

company, or funds involved in the laundering of those corrupt payments, to the Uzbek official.

colleagues in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom have
also provided valuable assistance. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance, as well. The SEC
referred the matter to the Department and also provided extensive cooperation and assistance.

The IRS-CI and ICE-HSI are investigating the cases as part of the IRS Global Illicit Financial Team in Washington, D.C. Senior Litigation Counsel
Nicola J. Mrazek and Trial Attorney Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Imperatore of
the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the criminal case, with substantial assistance from the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering
and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS). MLARS Trial Attorney Michael Khoo is prosecuting the forfeiture case with substantial assistance from the
Fraud Section and former MLARS Trial Attorney Marie M. Dalton, now an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Western District of Washington.

Two Defendants Charged for Their Role in Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Former High-Ranking Government Official in Panama

Individuals Facilitated $28 Million in Bribes from Odebrecht S.A. to the Official

A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, charging Luis Enrique Martinelli Linares (Luis Martinelli Linares)
and Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Linares (Ricardo Martinelli Linares) for their roles in a massive bribery and money laundering scheme involving
Odebrecht S.A. (Odebrecht), a Brazil-based global construction conglomerate.

On Dec. 21, 2016, Odebrecht pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York to a criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate
the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its involvement in the bribery and money laundering scheme.

The overarching Odebrecht scheme involved the payment of more than $700 million in bribes to government officials, public servants, political
parties, and others in Panama and other countries around the world to obtain and retain business for the company. The two individual
defendants are alleged to have participated in the scheme by, among other things, serving as intermediaries for approximately $28 million in
bribe payments made by and at the direction of Odebrecht to a then high-ranking government official in Panama (Panama Government Official),
who was a close relative of the defendants. Luis Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Martinelli Linares were each charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Luis Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Martinelli Linares were arrested at el Aeropuerto Internacional la Aurora in Guatemala on July 6 pursuant to a
provisional arrest request from the United States.

As alleged in the complaint, between approximately August 2009 and January 2014, the defendants facilitated the payment of bribes from
Odebrecht to or for the benefit of the Panama Government Official by taking a number of steps that included opening and managing secret
bank accounts held in the names of shell companies in foreign jurisdictions. These secret bank accounts were used to receive, transfer, and
deliver the bribe payments. The defendants served as the signatories on certain of the shell company bank accounts, and personally sent and
caused to be sent wire transfers through the structure of shell company bank accounts to conceal and spend bribery proceeds. Many of these

Texas Businessman Sentenced to 70 Months in Prison for Role in Venezuela Bribery Scheme and
Obstruction of Justice

A former procurement officer of Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), was
sentenced to 70 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release today for laundering the proceeds of a corrupt scheme to
secure contracts from PDVSA through bribery, underreporting income on his tax return and obstructing the governmentâs investigation into
bribes paid by the owner of U.S.-based companies to Venezuelan government officials in exchange for securing additional business with Citgo
Petroleum Corporation, a Houston-based PDVSA subsidiary.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Alfonzo Eliezer Gravina Munoz (Gravina), 57, of Katy, Texas, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller of the Southern District of
Texas. Judge Miller also ordered Gravina to pay restitution to the IRS in the amount of $214,849.21. Judge Miller previously entered a final
order of forfeiture on May 17, 2017, after Gravina forfeited $590,446 in connection with this case. Gravina pleaded guilty on Dec. 10, 2015, to
one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of making false statements in connection with a tax return. Based on his
actions after entry of his guilty plea in 2015, Gravina was indicted on Nov. 15, 2018, on one count of conspiracy to obstruct an official
proceeding, to which he pleaded guilty on Dec. 10, 2018.

According to admissions made in connection with Gravinaâs December 2015 plea, Gravina accepted bribes from U.S.-based businessmen
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera) and Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Rincon) while employed as a purchasing manager at PDVSA.
This ensured that Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies were placed on PDVSA bidding panels, which enabled the companies to win lucrative energy
contracts with PDVSA. Gravina admitted that he accepted over $590,000 in bribes from 2007 to 2014. In order to conceal the corrupt
payments, Rincon and Shiera transferred funds to Gravina from accounts they controlled outside of the United States to accounts in the names
of Gravinaâs associates and relatives. Gravina admitted that he did not report the bribe payments he received from Rincon, Shiera and others
as income on his 2010 tax return, thus underreporting his income. Rincon and Shiera have also pleaded guilty and await sentencing.

After his plea in December 2015, Gravina met periodically with HSI agents to provide information regarding corruption at PDVSA. Gravina
admitted that, during interviews with the government, he concealed facts about bribe payments to officials at Citgo Petroleum Corporation and,
at the same time, he provided details about the governmentâs investigation to a subject of the investigation, including about the topics
discussed during Gravinaâs meetings with the government. This passing of information led to the destruction of evidence and to the subjectâs
attempt to flee the United States in July 2018.

Gravina is the seventh defendant to be sentenced by Judge Miller as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery
at PDVSA. Including Gravina, Rincon and Shiera, to date, the Justice Department has announced charges against 26 individuals, 20 of whom
have pleaded guilty in connection with the investigation.

HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and IRS Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Jeremy
R. Sanders, Sarah E. Edwards and Sonali D. Patel of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Pearson and Robert
S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas
is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the Swiss Federal Office of Justice also provided assistance.

Chairman of a Macau Real Estate Development Company Convicted on All Counts for Role in
Scheme to Bribe United Nations Ambassadors to Build a Multi-Billion Dollar Conference Center

Yesterday, a federal jury convicted the chairman of a real estate development company for his role in a scheme to bribe United Nations
ambassadors to obtain support to build a conference center in Macau that would host, among other events, the annual United Nations Global
South-South Development Expo.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the
Southern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney, Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Chief Don Fort of
Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) made the announcement.

After a four week trial, Ng Lap Seng, a/k/a âDavid Ng,â 69, of Macau, China, was convicted of two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, one count of paying bribes and gratuities, one count of money laundering and two counts of conspiracy. No sentencing date has
been set.

âThe defendantâs corrupt activities were all the more egregious and shameful as he tried to hide his bribes as philanthropy,â said Acting
Assistant Attorney General Blanco. âCorruption is a disease that has a corrosive effect on the rule of law everywhere and harms good people
throughout the world. The Department is steadfast in its mission to aggressively investigate and prosecute bribery in all its forms, and
vigorously protect the rule of law.â

âIn his unbridled pursuit of even greater personal fortune, billionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations,â said
Acting U.S. Attorney Kim. âThrough bribes and no show jobs, Ng turned leaders of the league of nations into his private band of profiteers. Ngâs
journey from a Macau real estate mogul to convicted felon should serve as a cautionary tale to all tempted to follow his path. If you bring
corruption to New York - whether to the State Capitol in Albany or to the halls of the U.N. General Assembly - your journey may very well end in
a Manhattan federal courtroom, with a unanimous jury announcing your guilt.â

âNgâs bribery scheme began at the intersection where business and intergovernmental matters overlap,â said Assistant Director in Charge
Sweeney, Jr. He may have thought this was a good place to start, but itâs doubtful this was the ending he had in mind. This case is nothing more
than an example of corruption in its purest form, and weâve proven once again that no individual or organization is powerful enough to be
immune from prosecution.â

âToday's conviction is a result of untangling a global labyrinth of complex financial transactions used by Ng to facilitate bribes to foreign
officials,â said Chief Fort. âIRS-Cl has become a trusted leader in pursuit of those who use corruption as their business model to circumvent the
law. Cl is committed to maintaining fair competition, free of corrupt practices, through a dynamic synthesis of global teamwork and our robust
financial investigative talents.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a
former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to
the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (âUNGAâ). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who
worked with Ng and others and previously pleaded guilty, Ng orchestrated a scheme with the principal objective of obtaining the formal support
of the UN for a multi-billion dollar facility that Ng hoped to build in Macau using the Sun Kian Ip Group (the âMacau Conference Centerâ). Ng
wanted the Macau Conference Center to serve as a location for meetings, discussions, forums, and other events associated with the UN. In
particular, he wanted it to serve as the permanent home of the annual âGlobal South-South Development Expo,â which is run by the UN Office
for South-South Cooperation, and is hosted in a different country or city every year.

The trial evidence further showed that Ng bribed Ambassador Ashe and Ambassador Lorenzo (together, the âAmbassadorsâ) in exchange for
their agreement to use their official positions to advance Ngâs interest in obtaining formal UN support for the Macau Conference Center. As the
evidence demonstrated at trial, Ng paid the Ambassadors in a variety of forms. For example, Ng appointed Ambassador Lorenzo as the
President of South-South News, a New York-based organization â funded by Ng â which described itself as a media platform dedicated to
advancing the implementation of the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a set of philanthropic goals. Ng provided bribe payments to
Ambassador Lorenzo through South-South News by transmitting payments from Macau to a company in the Dominican Republic affiliated with
Ambassador Lorenzoâs brother (the âDominican Companyâ). Through South-South News, Ng also made payments to Ambassador Ashe,
including to Ambassador Asheâs wife, who was paid in her capacity as a âconsultantâ to South-South News, and to an account that Ambassador
Ashe had established, purportedly to raise money for his role as President of UNGA. Ng also provided bribes through cash and wire payments to
the Ambassadors.

According to the trial evidence, one of the actions that the Ambassadors took in exchange for bribe payments, to advance Ngâs objectives, was
to submit an official document to the then-UN Secretary-General in support of the Macau Conference Center (the âUN Documentâ). The UN
Document claimed that there was a need to build the Macau Conference Center to support the UNâs global development goals. Ambassador
Ashe, aided by Ambassador Lorenzo, initially submitted the UN Document to the UNGA in or about late February 2012. More than a year later,
at Ngâs behest, the Ambassadors revised the UN Document to refer specifically to Ngâs company, the Sun Kian Ip Group, as a partner in the
Macau Conference Center project. The UN Document requested that the Secretary-General circulate the UN Document âas a document of the
sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly,â under a specific item of the official UNGA agenda. The Secretary-General followed this request,
thereby making the UN Document an official part of the UNGA record.
Five other defendants have been charged in this matter. Co-conspirators Lorenzo, Yin and Heidi Hong Piao have pleaded guilty and are awaiting
sentencing. Shiwei Yan has pleaded and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Co-defendant Ashe passed away in 2016 and the charges
against him were dismissed.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-ClI. Trial Attorney David A. Last of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Janis M. Echenberg and Douglas S. Zolkind of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Micronesian Government Official Sentenced to Prison for Role in Money Laundering Scheme
Involving FCPA Violations

A Micronesian government official was sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release yesterday for his
participation in a money laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure engineering and project management contracts from the
government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney
General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Special Agent in Charge Eli S. Miranda of the FBIâs Honolulu
Field Office.

Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen, was sentenced in Honolulu by U.S. District Judge Susan O. Mollway of the District of Hawaii. Halbert
pleaded guilty on April 2 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to commit money laundering.

According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, Halbert was a government official in the FSM Department of Transportation,
Communications and Infrastructure who administered FSMâs aviation programs, including the management of its airports. Halbert admitted
that between 2006 and 2016, a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company owned by Frank James Lyon paid bribes to FSM officials,
including Halbert, to obtain and retain contracts with the FSM government valued at nearly $8 million, in violation of the FCPA. Lyon and
Halbert agreed that these bribe payments would be transported from the United States to the FSM.

Lyon, 53, of Honolulu, Hawaii, pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to
violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to commit federal program fraud. Lyon was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison on May
13.

The FBI investigated this case. Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section is prosecuting the case. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Department of Transportationâs Office of Inspector General provided significant assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Departmentâs FCPA

Chairman of Macau Real Estate Development Company Sentenced to Prison for Role in Scheme to
Bribe United Nations Ambassadors to Build A Multi-Billion Dollar Conference Center

The chairman of a real estate development company was sentenced today to 48 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his
role in a scheme to bribe United Nations ambassadors to obtain support to build a conference center in Macau that would host, among other
events, the annual United Nations Global South-South Development Expo.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the
Southern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Special Agent in Charge
James D. Robnett of the IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) New York Field Office made the announcement.

Ng Lap Seng, aka âDavid Ng,â 69, of Macau, China, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick of the Southern District of New
York. In addition to his prison sentence, Judge Broderick ordered Ng to pay a $1 million fine and $302, 977 in restitution to the United Nations.
He also ordered a forfeiture money judgment of $1.5 million in forfeiture. Ng must report to the U.S. Marshals Service by July 10 to start his
prison sentence. Ng was convicted on July 27, 2017, after a five-week trial of two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, one
count of paying bribes and gratuities, one count of money laundering and two counts of conspiracy.

âCorruption at any level of government undermines the rule of law and cannot be tolerated,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan.
âBut corruption is especially corrosive when it occurs at an international body like the United Nations. By paying bribes to two U.N.
ambassadors to advance his interest in obtaining formal support for the Macau conference center project, Ng Lap Seng tried to manipulate the
functions of the United Nations. The sentence handed down today demonstrates that those who engage in corruption will pay a heavy price
and serves as a reminder that no one stands above the law.â

âBillionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations in pursuit of a multibillion-dollar real estate deal in Macau,â said U.S.
Attorney Berman. âNg exploited a center for international diplomacy as an instrument for his greedy intentions. This Office is committed to
policing official corruption wherever it may be found.â

âGaining the upper hand in a business venture by engaging in corrupt practices is bribery in its purest form. Today, Ng Lap Seng has learned
the price he will have to pay for his actions,â said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. â| commend the investigators and prosecutors who
continue to work together at home and abroad to vigorously enforce the law within the confines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âNo matter if money is funneled through New York corporations or transferred offshore, IRS-Cl is always ready to follow the money,â said IRS-Cl
Special Agent-in-Charge Robnett. âTodayâs sentencing shows that IRS-Cl is committed to rooting out public corruption by investigating
individuals who misuse their positions of public trust for personal financial gain.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a
former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to
the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who

Credit Suisseâs Investment Bank in Hong Kong Agrees to Pay $47 Million Criminal Penalty for
Corrupt Hiring Scheme that Violated the FCPA

Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Limited (CSHK), a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of Credit Suisse Group AG (CSAG), a Swiss-based issuer of publicly
traded securities in the United States, reached a resolution with the Department of Justice and agreed to pay a $47 million criminal penalty for
its role in a scheme to corruptly win banking business by awarding employment to friends and family of Chinese officials.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the
Eastern District of New York and Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âCredit Suisse (Hong Kong) Limited engaged in a corrupt scheme to win business with Chinese state-owned entities by hiring friends and family
of Chinese government officials, generating the bank at least $46 million in profits,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThese
ârelationship hiresâ often lacked necessary technical skills, and offered fewer qualifications and significantly less relevant banking experience
than other candidates for the jobs. The Department of Justice remains steadfast in our commitment to combatting bribery and corruption in all
its many forms, including where companies engage in corrupt hiring practices to gain the favor of foreign officials to generate improper
business advantages and increase profits.â

âCredit Suisse Hong Kongâs practice of employing friends and family members of Chinese government officials as a quid pro quo for lucrative
business opportunities was both profitable and corrupt and now the company will pay the price for that corruption,â said U.S. Attorney
Donoghue. âThis Office is committed to holding companies that conduct business in the United States accountable when they or their
subsidiaries corruptly influence foreign government officials for financial gain.â

âIn the banking industry, not every undertaking is fair game,â said Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. âTrading employment opportunities
for less-than-qualified individuals in exchange for lucrative business deals is an example of nepotism at its finest. The criminal penalty imposed
today provides explicit insight into the level of corruption that took place at the hands of Credit Suisse Group AGâs Hong Kong-based
subsidiary.â

According to CSHKâs admissions, between 2007 and 2013, several senior CSHK managers in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region engaged in a practice
to hire, promote and retain candidates referred by or related to government officials and executives of clients that were state-owned entities
(SOEs). The employment of these ârelationship hiresâ or âreferral hiresâ was part of a quid pro quo with the officials who referred the
candidates for employment, whereby CSHK bankers sought to and did win business from the referral sources. Employees of other subsidiaries
of CSAG were aware of the referral hires and facilitated the conduct.

According to admissions made in connection with the resolution, CSHK bankers discussed and approved the hiring of close friends and family of
Chinese officials in order to secure business for CSHK. For example, one SOE executive emailed a senior CSHK banker to refer a candidate who
had a âvery good and close relationshipâ with senior management at the SOE, and wrote that hiring the referral hire would âbring [CSHK] the
big surprise in the near future if [CSHK] could ... arrange a position in CS team in Beijing.â The senior CSHK banker later told a colleague about
an impending deal that the SOE was pursuing and explained that the referring SOE official âwas focused on having us make a relationship hire
and said it was very important for us to win future business with [the SOE].â In another email to colleagues, a CSHK employee explained that
â[rlelationship hires have to translate to $â or âthe relationship is worthless to our organization.â

CSHK further admitted that referral hires were less qualified than other employees hired at the same level, they were less stringently vetted
and they were given benefits throughout the course of their employment due to the provision of business to CSHK by their referral sources. For
example, in relation to the interview process for one referral hire, a senior CSHK banker cautioned colleagues ânot too many interviews,â as this
referral hire was âa princess [who was] not used to too many rounds of interview.â CSHK employees also noted that they had to âbe a bit
âcreativeâ in fillingâ in this referral hireâs resume, before sending it to other CSHK employees. In another example, when a CSHK banker asked a
high-ranking executive of a client SOE to âpush for [CSHKâs] incentive,â the high-ranking executive âreminded [the CSHK banker] that [CSHK]
need[ed] to pay [the SOEâs] relationship hire ... well at the year-end bonus.â

The corrupt scheme netted CSHK at least $46 million in profits from business mandates with Chinese SOEs, CSHK admitted.

The Department and CSHK entered into a non-prosecution agreement, and CSHK agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $47,029,916 to resolve the
matter. As part of the agreement, CSHK and its parent company Credit Suisse AG also agreed to continue to cooperate with the Department in
any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, to enhance their compliance programs and to report to the Department on
the implementation of their enhanced compliance programs. The Department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including
that CSHK did not voluntarily and timely disclose the conduct at issue. CSHK received partial credit for its and its parent companyâs cooperation
with the criminal investigation, including making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States and producing
documents to the government from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws. However, CSHK did not receive
additional cooperation credit because its cooperation was reactive and not proactive. Additionally, CSHK did not receive full credit for
remediation because it failed to sufficiently discipline employees who were involved in the misconduct. Based on these considerations, the
company received a non-prosecution agreement and an aggregate discount of 15 percent off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine
range.

In related proceedings, Credit Suisse Group AG also settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under the terms of its
resolution with the SEC, Credit Suisse Group AG agreed to pay a total of $24,989,843 in disgorgement of profits and $4,833,961 in prejudgment
interest.

The FBI's New York Field Office investigated the case. Trial Attorney Katherine Nielsen and former Trial Attorney Allison Westfahl-Kong of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alicyn Cooley, Alixandra Smith and James P. McDonald of the Eastern District of
New Yorkâs Business and Securities Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Fraud Section and U.S. Attorneyâs Office appreciate the significant
cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.

Departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Beam Suntory Inc. Agrees to Pay Over $19 Million to Resolve Criminal Foreign Bribery Case

Beam Suntory Inc. (Beam), a Chicago-based company that produces and sells distilled beverages, has agreed to pay a criminal monetary
penalty of $19,572,885 to resolve the departmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).

The resolution arises in part out of Beamâs scheme to pay a bribe to an Indian government official in exchange for approval of a license to bottle
a line of products that Beam sought to market and sell in India, and related internal controls and books and records violations, which included
efforts by a then-member of Beamâs legal department to affirmatively avoid uncovering information related to improper activities and practices
by third-parties engaged by Beam in India that presented corruption risks.

Beam entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the
Northern District of Illinois in connection with a criminal information unsealed today in the Northern District of Illinois charging Beam with one
count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the FCPA.

âBeam and its Indian subsidiary not only paid bribes to Indian government officials, they intentionally failed to implement internal controls to
prevent bribery and falsified their books and records to conceal the corrupt activity,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of
the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âCompanies that use corrupt influence instead of competing in a fair, ethical, and honest manner
should take note of todayâs agreement: paying bribes to obtain and retain business is not business as usual, it is a crime.â

âU.S. companies that attempt to gain the upper hand in foreign business ventures by engaging in corruption must be held accountable,â said
U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. for the Northern District of Illinois. âThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a long reach, and for good reason. It
is critical that our global economy remain on a fair playing field.â

âBribery undermines the public's trust in our markets, and the FBI will never stop fighting to hold corrupt companies accountable whenever and
wherever they abuse that trust,â said Special Agent in Charge Emmerson Buie Jr. of the FBIâs Chicago Office.

According to its admissions, Beam conspired with others to violate the FCPA by, among other things, engaging in a scheme to pay a bribe of one
million Indian Rupees (approximately equal to $18,000 at the then exchange rate) to a senior Indian government official in exchange for that
officialâs approval of a license to bottle âReady-to-Drinkâ (RTD) products that Beam sought to market and sell in India through its subsidiary,
Beam Global Spirits & Wine (India) Private Ltd. (Beam India). The bribe was authorized by a high-ranking executive at Beamâs Asia Pacific/South
America regional business unit, who directed that the payment be made through Beam Indiaâs third-party bottler in order to conceal it.

According to its admissions, from the time Beam acquired the Indian business in 2006 through the end of the third quarter of 2012, Beam India
paid bribes and made other improper payments to various Indian government officials, including corrupt payments to obtain or retain business
in the Indian market. Most of the corrupt payments were made through third-party sales promoters and distributors, who paid government
officials to secure orders of Beam products at government controlled depots and retail stores, obtain prominent placement of Beam products in
government retail stores, acquire and renew label registrations and licenses, and enable the distribution of Beam spirit products from Beam
Indiaâs Behror bottling facility to warehouses in other states throughout India.

As part of the conspiracy, Beam also agreed with others to fail to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls,
which would have helped to detect and halt Beam Indiaâs longstanding practice of making corrupt payments to Indian government officials, and
to falsify its books and records. On numerous occasions, Beam was cautioned by outside advisors regarding the need to implement sufficient
internal accounting controls relating to risks associated with improper activities by third parties in India, but Beam failed to implement sufficient
controls. Beam also maintained falsely recorded expenses, including corrupt payments concealed as commission expenses, and falsified
certifications, including false sub-certification letters submitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in its consolidated books, records, and
accounts.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Beam agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing or future criminal
investigations concerning Beam, its executives, employees, or agents. In addition, under the agreement, Beam agreed to enhance its
compliance program and to report to the government on the implementation of its enhanced compliance program.

The government reached this resolution with Beam based on a number of factors, including the failure to timely disclose the conduct that
triggered the investigation; the nature and seriousness of the offense, including the involvement of a then-executive officer of Beam, a then-
high-level employee in Beamâs Legal Department, and a then-high-level executive at Beam India; the lack of an effective compliance program
at the time of the misconduct; the companyâs failure to fully cooperate, including positions taken by Beam that were not consistent with full
cooperation, as well as significant delays caused by Beam in reaching a timely resolution and its refusal to accept responsibility for several
years; and Beamâs failure to fully remediate, including its failure to discipline certain individuals involved in the conduct.

The criminal monetary penalty for Beam reflects a 10 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because
Beam received partial credit for its remediation and cooperation with the governmentâs investigation.

In July 2018, in a related matter with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Beam agreed to pay the SEC disgorgement and
prejudgment interest totaling approximately $6 million and a civil monetary penalty of $2 million but the department is not crediting any
portion of the penalty paid to the SEC because Beam did not seek to coordinate a parallel resolution with the department.
The FBI's Chicago Office investigated the case. Trial Attorneys John-Alex Romano and Della Sentilles of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tyler C. Murray of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case.

The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

SBM Offshore N.V. And United States-Based Subsidiary Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Case Involving Bribes in Five Countries

Company Agrees to Pay $238 Million; Subsidiary Pleads Guilty

SBM Offshore N.V. (SBM), a Netherlands-based company specializing in the manufacture and design of offshore oil drilling equipment, and its
wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, SBM Offshore USA Inc. (SBM USA), have agreed to resolve criminal charges and pay a criminal penalty of $238
million in connection with schemes involving the bribery of foreign officials in Brazil, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan and Iraq in violation
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). SBM USA pleaded guilty today in connection with the resolution.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez of the
Southern District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (ICE-HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

âThis corrupt scheme involved some of the highest-level executives within the company, spanned five countries, and lasted for more than a
decade,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe resolution announced today demonstrates the Criminal Divisionâs continuing
commitment to work closely with our foreign partners to hold both companies and individuals accountable for their actions as we continue to
level the playing field for ethical and honest businesses to compete in the marketplace.â

âDeterring corporate crime requires enforcing the law on multiple fronts,â said Acting U.S. Attorney Martinez. âThese cases involve both
individual and corporate misconduct, which the guilty pleas reflect. We will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute individuals and
corporations who violate the FCPA and those who misuse our financial system to do so.â

âThis case exemplifies how HSI works diligently with our foreign law enforcement partners to promote and protect international trade practices,
ensuring a fair and equal playing field for U.S. companies and consumers,â said HSI Special Agent in Charge Dawson.

SBM entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with a criminal information filed today in the Southern District of Texas
charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge David
Hittner. In addition, SBM USA pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Judge Hittner on a one-count criminal information charging the company
with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to its agreement with the Department, SBM agreed to pay a total
criminal penalty of $238 million to the United States, including a $500,000 criminal fine and $13.2 million in criminal forfeiture that SBM agreed
to pay on behalf of SBM USA.

According to the companiesâ admissions and court documents, beginning by at least 1996 and continuing until at least 2012, SBM conspired to
violate the FCPA by paying more than $180 million in commissions to intermediaries, knowing that a portion of those commissions would be
used to bribe foreign officials in Brazil, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan and Iraq. SBM made these payments in order to influence those
officials, for the purpose of securing improper advantages and obtaining or retaining business with state-owned oil companies in the five named
countries. SBM acknowledged that it gained at least $2.8 billion from projects it obtained from these state-owned oil companies.

The Justice Department resolution follows guilty pleas by two former SBM executives. On Nov. 9, Anthony Mace, the former CEO of SBM and a
former member of the board of directors of SBM USA, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. On Nov. 6, Robert Zubiate,
a former SBM USA executive, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Mace and Zubiate are awaiting sentencing.

In 2014, SBM settled with the Dutch Public Prosecutorâs Office (Openbaar Ministerie) over related conduct and paid the Netherlands a total $200
million in disgorged profits and a $40 million fine. SBM has paid a combined worldwide total in criminal penalties in excess of $475
million.

The Department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that while SBM brought the conduct to the attention of
the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Dutch authorities, it did not provide a complete disclosure for approximately one year; that SBM did
cooperate with the Departmentâs investigation, including an accelerated investigation into bribery conduct related to Kazakhstan and Iraq; and
that SBM has undertaken significant remedial measures, including terminating and demoting employees who were involved in the criminal
conduct, terminating longstanding agency agreements and implementing a new and enhanced system of internal controls to address and
mitigate corruption and compliance risks. Therefore, SBM was entitled to a 25 percent reduction off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines range. In addition, the Department considered SBMâs inability to pay a fine.

In calculating its fine, the Department credited SBMâs payment of penalties to the Openbaar Ministerie and the payment of penalties likely to be
paid to the Brazilian MinistÃ©rio Publico Federal (MPF).

The Department of Justice is grateful to Brazilâs MPF, the Netherlandsâ Dutch Public Prosecutorâs Office (Openbaar Ministerie) and Switzerlandâs
Office of the Attorney General and Federal Office of Justice for providing substantial assistance in gathering evidence during this investigation.
ICE-HSI investigated the case. Trial Attorney Dennis R. Kihm and Assistant Chief Tarek Helou of the Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Suzanne Elmilady of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided
substantial assistance in this matter. The FBIâs International Corruption Squad and the Internal Revenue Serviceâs Criminal Investigation
Division assisted with portions of the investigation of this case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

Micronesian Government Official Sentenced to Prison for Role in Money Laundering Scheme
Involving FCPA Violations

A Micronesian government official was sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release yesterday for his
participation in a money laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure engineering and project management contracts from the
government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney
General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Special Agent in Charge Eli S. Miranda of the FBIâs Honolulu
Field Office.

Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen, was sentenced in Honolulu by U.S. District Judge Susan O. Mollway of the District of Hawaii. Halbert
pleaded guilty on April 2 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to commit money laundering.

According to admissions made as part of his plea agreement, Halbert was a government official in the FSM Department of Transportation,
Communications and Infrastructure who administered FSMâs aviation programs, including the management of its airports. Halbert admitted
that between 2006 and 2016, a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company owned by Frank James Lyon paid bribes to FSM officials,
including Halbert, to obtain and retain contracts with the FSM government valued at nearly $8 million, in violation of the FCPA. Lyon and
Halbert agreed that these bribe payments would be transported from the United States to the FSM.

Lyon, 53, of Honolulu, Hawaii, pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging him with conspiracy to
violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to commit federal program fraud. Lyon was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison on May
13.

The FBI investigated this case. Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section is prosecuting the case. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Department of Transportationâs Office of Inspector General provided significant assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Airbus Agrees to Pay over $3.9 Billion in Global Penalties to Resolve Foreign Bribery and ITAR
Case

Airbus SE (Airbus or the Company), a global provider of civilian and military aircraft based in France, has agreed to pay combined penalties of
more than $3.9 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges with authorities in the United States, France and the United Kingdom arising out of the
Companyâs scheme to use third-party business partners to bribe government officials, as well as non-governmental airline executives, around
the world and to resolve the Companyâs violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), in the United States. This is the largest global foreign bribery resolution to date.

Airbus entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed on Jan. 28, 2020 in
the District of Columbia charging the Company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
and conspiracy to violate the AECA and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. The FCPA charge arose out of Airbusâs scheme to offer and pay
bribes to foreign officials, including Chinese officials, in order to obtain and retain business, including contracts to sell aircraft. The AECA charge
stems from Airbusâs willful failure to disclose political contributions, commissions or fees to the U.S. government, as required under the ITAR, in
connection with the sale or export of defense articles and defense services to the Armed Forces of a foreign country or international
organization. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the District of Columbia.

âAirbus engaged in a multi-year and massive scheme to corruptly enhance its business interests by paying bribes in China and other countries
and concealing those bribes,â said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThis
coordinated resolution was possible thanks to the dedicated efforts of our foreign partners at the Serious Fraud Office in the United Kingdom
and the PNF in France. The Department will continue to work aggressively with our partners across the globe to root out corruption, particularly
corruption that harms American interests.â

âInternational corruption involving sensitive U.S. defense technology presents a particularly dangerous combination. Todayâs announcement
demonstrates the Departmentâs continuing commitment to ensuring that those who violate our export control laws are held to account,â said
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General David P. Burns of the Justice Departmentâs National Security Division (NSD). âThe resolution,
however, also reflects the significant benefits available under NSDâs revised voluntary self-disclosure policy for companies that choose to self-
report export violations, cooperate, and remediate as to those violations, even where there are aggravating circumstances. We hope other
companies will make the same decision as Airbus to report potential criminal export violations timely and directly to NSD so that they too can
avail themselves of the policyâs benefits.â

âToday, Airbus has admitted to a years-long campaign of corruption around the world, said U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District of
Columbia. âThrough bribes, Airbus allowed rampant corruption to invade the U.S. system. Additionally, Airbus falsely reported information
about their conduct to the U.S. government for more than five years in order to gain valuable licenses to export U.S. military technology. This
case exemplifies the ability of our prosecutors and law enforcement to work with our foreign counterparts to ensure that corruption around the
world is prevented and punished at the highest levels.â

âAirbus SE, the second largest Aerospace company world-wide, engaged in a systematic and deliberate conspiracy, that knowingly and willfully
violated U.S. fraud and export laws,â said Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland
Security Investigations (HSI) New York. âAirbusâs fraud and bribery in commercial aircraft transactions strengthened corrupt airlines and bad
actors worldwide, at the expense of straightforward enterprises. Additionally, the bribery of government officials, specifically those involved in
the procurement of U.S. military technology, posed a national security threat to both the U.S. and its allies. The global threats facing the U.S.
have never been greater than they are today, and HSI New York is committed to working with our federal and international partners to assure
sensitive U.S. technologies are not unlawfully and fraudulently acquired. As this investigation reflects, national security continues to be a top
priority not just for Department of Homeland Security, but for HSI New York.â

The Companyâs payment to the United States will be $527 million for the FCPA and ITAR violations, and an additional 50 million Euros
(approximately $55 million) as part of a civil forfeiture agreement for the ITAR-related conduct, and the department will credit a portion of the
amount the Company pays to the Parquet National Financier (PNF) in France under the Companyâs agreement with the PNF. In addition, the
Company has agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to the U.S. Department of Stateâs Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), of which the
department is crediting $5 million. In related proceedings, the Company settled with the PNF in France over bribes paid to government officials
and non-governmental airline executives in China and multiple other countries and the Company has agreed to pay more than 2 billion Euros
(more than approximately $2.29 billion) pursuant to the PNF agreement. As part of this coordinated global resolution, the Company also
entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over bribes paid in Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Taiwan, Indonesia and Ghana, and the Company has agreed to pay approximately 990 million Euros equivalent (approximately $1.09 billion)
pursuant to the SFO agreement. The PNF and SFO had investigated the Company as part of a Joint Investigative Team.

According to admissions and court documents, beginning in at least 2008 and continuing until at least 2015, Airbus engaged in and facilitated a
scheme to offer and pay bribes to decision makers and other influencers, including to foreign officials, in order to obtain improper business
advantages and to win business from both privately owned enterprises and entities that were state-owned and state-controlled. In furtherance
of the corrupt bribery scheme, Airbus employees and agents, among other things, sent emails while located in the United States and
participated in and provided luxury travel to foreign officials within the United States.
The admissions and court documents establish that in order to conceal and to facilitate the bribery scheme, Airbus engaged certain business
partners, in part, to assist in the bribery scheme. Between approximately 2013 and 2015, Airbus engaged a business partner in China and
knowingly and willfully conspired to make payments to the business partner that were intended to be used as bribes to government officials in
China in connection with the approval of certain agreements in China associated with the purchase and sale of Airbus aircraft to state-owned
and state-controlled airlines in China. In order to conceal the payments and to conceal its engagement of the business partner in China, Airbus
did not pay the business partner directly but instead made payments to a bank account in Hong Kong in the name of a company controlled by
another business partner.

Pursuant to the AECA and ITAR, the DDTC regulates the export and import of U.S. defense articles and defense services, and prohibits their
export overseas without the requisite licensing and approval of the DDTC. According to admissions and court documents, between December
2011 and December 2016, Airbus filed numerous applications for the export of defense articles and defense services to foreign armed forces.
As part of its applications, Airbus was required under Part 130 of the ITAR to provide certain information related to political contributions, fees or
commissions paid in connection with the sale of defense articles or defense services. The admissions and court documents reveal, however,
that the Company engaged in a criminal conspiracy to knowingly and willfully violate the AECA and ITAR, by failing to provide DDTC with
accurate information related to commissions paid by Airbus to third-party brokers who were hired to solicit, promote or otherwise secure the
sale of defense articles and defense services to foreign armed forces.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement with the department, Airbus has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any
ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals, and to enhance its compliance program.

For the FCPA-related conduct, the department reached this resolution with Airbus based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs
cooperation and remediation. In addition, for the FCPA-related conduct, the U.S. resolution recognizes the strength of Franceâs and the United
Kingdomâs interests over the Companyâs corruption-related conduct, as well as the compelling equities of France and the United Kingdom to
vindicate their respective interests as those countries deem appropriate, and the department has taken into account these countriesâ
determination of the appropriate resolution into all aspects of the U.S. resolution.

With respect to the AECA and ITAR-related conduct, the department reached this resolution with Airbus based on the voluntary and timely
nature of its disclosure to the department as well as the Companyâs cooperation and remediation.

HSIâs New York Field Office Counter Proliferation Investigations Group is investigating the case. Deputy Chief Christopher Cestaro, Assistant
Chief Vanessa Sisti and Trial Attorney Elina A. Rubin Smith of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, Deputy Chief Elizabeth L. D. Cannon and
Trial Attorney David Lim of the National Security Divisionâs Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle
Zamarin, Gregg Maisel, David Kent and Karen Seifert of the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's Office of
International Affairs provided assistance.

The Department of Justice acknowledges and expresses its appreciation of the significant assistance provided by Franceâs Parquet National
Financier and the UKâs Serious Fraud Office.

The Fraud Section is responsible for all investigations and prosecutions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and conducts other investigations
into sophisticated economic crimes. The Counterintelligence and Export Control Section supervises the investigation and prosecution of cases
involving the export of military and strategic commodities and technology, including cases under the AECA and ITAR.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, February 26, 2019

Two Businessmen Charged with Foreign Bribery in Connection with Venezuela Bribery Scheme

A former sales representative and the president of a U.S.-based company were charged in an indictment unsealed today on foreign bribery, wire
fraud and money laundering charges for their alleged roles in a scheme to corruptly secure business advantages, including contracts and
payment on past due invoices, from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Rafael Enrique Pinto Franceschi (Pinto), 40, of Miami, Florida, and Franz Herman Muller Huber (Muller), 68, of Weston, Florida, were charged ina
five-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Feb. 21, and unsealed today. Pinto and Muller made their initial
appearances today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Goodman of the Southern District of Florida. Pinto and Muller are each charged with
one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire
fraud, and one count of conspiracy to launder money.

The indictment alleges that beginning in or around 2009 and continuing through at least 2013, Pinto, a sales representative for a Miami-based
PDVSA supplier (âCompany Aâ in the indictment), and Muller, the President of Company A, conspired with others to bribe three PDVSA officials
in exchange for providing assistance in connection with Company Aâs PDVSA business. According to the indictment, in exchange for bribe
payments the PDVSA officials allegedly assisted Company A in obtaining additional PDVSA contracts, inside information and payment on past
due invoices. The indictment alleges that when Company A received a payment from PDVSA, Pinto would alert one of the PDVSA officials who
would, in turn, create a fictitious invoice from a Panamanian shell company charging Company A three percent of whatever payment Company
A had received from PDVSA and directing Company A to send payment to a Swiss bank account. According to the charges, the false invoice
would be sent to Muller, who would ensure that the invoices were paid.

The wire fraud charges against Pinto and Muller are based on allegations that, in addition to directing Company A money to the three PDVSA
officials to benefit Company A, Pinto and Muller received kickbacks in connection with the scheme. In total, Pinto is alleged to have received
over $985,000 in kickback payments, and Muller over $258,000.

Two of the three officials that Pinto and Muller are accused of bribing - Jose Camacho and Ivan Guedez, both of Houston - have already pleaded
guilty in connection with the case and are pending sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 21 individuals, 15 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI Boston and Miami. Trial Attorneys Sarah E. Edwards and Sonali D. Patel of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys John P. Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant
U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollison of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice, and the Cayman Mutual Legal Assistance Authority and
Cayman Office of the Director of Public Prosecution also provided assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Departmentâs FCPA

enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice. gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras Agrees to Pay More Than $850 Million for FCPA Violations

Reaches Agreement with Brazilian Authorities in Related Investigation

PetrdÃ©leo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (Petrobras), a Brazilian state-owned and state-controlled energy company, entered into agreements with U.S.
and Brazilian authorities and agreed to pay a combined total of $853.2 million in penalties to resolve the U.S. government's investigation into
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with Petrobrasâs role in facilitating payments to politicians and political
parties in Brazil, as well as a related Brazilian investigation.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger of the
Eastern District of Virginia and Assistant Director Robert Johnson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division made the announcement.

âExecutives at the highest levels of Petrobrasâincluding members of its Executive Board and Board of Directorsâfacilitated the payment of
hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Brazilian politicians and political parties and then cooked the books to conceal the bribe payments
from investors and regulators,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Sectionâtogether with our
partners in the Eastern District of Virginia, the SEC, and the FBIâare grateful for the assistance provided by our Brazilian law enforcement
counterparts. This case is just the most recent example of our ability to work with our foreign counterparts to investigate companies and other
criminal actors whose conduct spans multiple international jurisdictions.â

âProtecting the integrity of U.S. financial markets is one of the highest priorities of this Administration,â said U.S. Attorney Terwilliger. âThose
who choose to access our Capital markets while failing to disclose the corrupt activities of company executives will be held accountable. | want
to thank our law enforcement partners for their diligence and dedication in pursing this important case.â

âTodayâs global resolution demonstrates the FBIâs commitment to thoroughly investigating and holding accountable those international
companies who seek to take advantage of our financial system while also facilitating bribes and fraud in other countries,â said FBI Assistant
Director Johnson. âThe hefty $853.2 million criminal penalty should act as a deterrent to anyone seeking to perpetrate this kind of fraud in the
future. This case proves that no company is above the law and that corruption that spans borders will not be tolerated by the United States. |
want to thank the agents, analysts, and prosecutors who investigated this case in parallel with Brazilian authorities. We will continue to pursue
any and all companies and individuals throughout the world who disregard the rule of law and threaten our fair and competitive marketplace for
their personal gain.â

âTodayâs substantial resolution demonstrates the FBIâs continued commitment to working with U.S. and international partners to investigate
corruption no matter where it occurs,â said Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBI Washington Field Officeâs Criminal Division.
âWe remain committed to holding companies and executives who violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act accountable for their activity, and
we will continue to work diligently to uphold the integrity of an increasingly global marketplace.""

According to Petrobrasâs admissions, while the companyâs American Depository Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, members of
the Petrobras Executive Board were involved in facilitating and directing millions of dollars in corrupt payments to politicians and political
parties in Brazil, and members of Petrobrasâs Board of Directors were also involved in facilitating bribes that a major Petrobras contractor was
paying to Brazilian politicians. During this period, for example, a Petrobras executive directed the payment of illicit funds to stop a
parliamentary inquiry into Petrobras contracts, and the executive also directed payments received from Petrobras contractors to be corruptly
used to pay millions of dollars to the campaign of a Brazilian politician who had oversight over the location where one of Petrobrasâs refineries
was being built.

Petrobras admitted that it failed to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflected the companyâs capitalization
of property, plant and equipment as a result of the bribes being generated by the companyâs contractors with the cooperation of certain
Petrobras executives, and that certain Petrobras executives signed false Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 302 sub-certifications while they were involved
in, and were aware that other executives at Petrobras were involved in, obtaining and facilitating the payment of millions of dollars in bribes to
Brazilian politicians, to Brazilian political parties and to themselves. Petrobras also admitted that certain executives failed to implement internal
financial and accounting controls in order to continue to facilitate bribe payments to Brazilian politicians and Brazilian political parties.

Petrobras entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $853.2 million to resolve the matter. This reflects
a 25 percent discount off the low end of the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range for the companyâs full cooperation and
remediation. In related proceedings, Petrobras reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Petrobras
entered into an agreement to reach a settlement with the Ministerio Publico Federal in Brazil. Under the non-prosecution agreement, the United
States will credit the amount that Petrobras pays to the SEC and Brazil under their respective agreements, with the Department of Justice and
the SEC receiving 10 percent ($85,320,000) each and Brazil receiving the remaining 80 percent ($682,560,000). As part of the agreement,
Petrobras has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct,
including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program and to report to the Department on the implementation of its enhanced compliance
program.

The Department reached this resolution based on a number of unique factors presented by this case, including that Petrobras is a Brazilian-
owned company that entered into a resolution with Brazilian authorities and is subject to oversight by Brazilian authorities, and that, in addition
to the significant misconduct engaged in by Petrobras, a number of executives of the company engaged in an embezzlement scheme that
victimized the company and its shareholders. In addition, the company did not voluntarily disclose the conduct, but did notify the government
of its intent to fully cooperate after learning of the allegations of misconduct; Petrobras fully cooperated in the investigation and fully
remediated. Petrobrasâs cooperation included conducting a thorough internal investigation, proactively sharing in real time facts discovered
during the internal investigation and sharing information that would not have been otherwise available to the Department, making regular
factual presentations to the Department, facilitating interviews of and information from foreign witnesses, and voluntarily collecting, analyzing
and organizing voluminous evidence and information for the Department in response to requests, including translating key documents.
Petrobras also took extensive remedial measures, including replacing the Board of Directors and the Executive Board (the companyâs high-level
managers) and implementing governance reforms, as well as disciplining employees and ensuring that the company no longer employs or is
affiliated with any of the individuals known to the company to be implicated in the conduct at issue in the case.

In the related SEC matter, Petrobras also agreed to pay to the SEC disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling $933,473,797, which shall
be reduced by the amount of any payment Petrobras makes to the class action Settlement Fund in the matter of In re Petrobras Securities
Litigation, No. 14-cv-9662 (S.D.N.Y.).

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C. investigated the case. Assistant Chiefs Christopher Cestaro and Lorinda Laryea
and Trial Attorney Derek Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Grace Hill of the Eastern District of Virginia
prosecuted the case.

The Department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by the SEC and the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs in this
case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, March 25, 2019

Former Head of Organization Backed by Chinese Energy Conglomerate Sentenced to Three Years
in Prison for International Bribery and Money Laundering Offenses

Schemed to Bribe the President of Chad and the President and Foreign Minister of Uganda

Chi Ping Patrick Ho, aka âPatrick C.P. Hoâ and âHe Zhiping,â was sentenced today to serve 36 months in prison for his role in a multi-year,
multimillion-dollar scheme to bribe top officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for CEFC China Energy Company
Limited (âCEFC Chinaâ) Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney
Geoffrey S. Berman for the Southern District of New York announced. Ho was convicted of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA), money laundering, and conspiracy to commit the same, in December 2018, after a one-week jury trial before U.S. District Judge Loretta
A. Preska, who imposed todayâs sentence.

In addition to his prison term, Ho, 69, a citizen of the Peopleâs Republic of China who resided in Hong Kong prior to his arrest in November 2017
and has been detained since his arrest, was fined $400,000. Following his prison sentence, Ho will be removed from the United States.

âPatrick Ho bribed officials at the highest levels of government in Chad and Uganda in pursuit of lucrative oil deals and other business
opportunities, all while using a U.S.-based NGO to conceal his criminal scheme,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThis kind of
corruption undermines world markets and tilts the playing field against law-abiding companies and individuals. The Department will continue to
investigate and prosecute individuals and corporations that engage in foreign bribery. â

âPatrick Ho schemed to bribe the leaders of Chad and Uganda in order to secure unfair business advantages for the Chinese energy company
he served,â said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Berman. âHis actions were brazen, including offering the president of Chad $2 million in cash, hidden
in gift boxes. Foreign corruption undermines the fairness of international markets, erodes the publicâs faith in its leaders, and is deeply unfair to
the people and businesses that play by the rules. Todayâs sentence recognizes the severe harm caused by Hoâs actions.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ho orchestrated and executed two bribery schemes to pay top officials of Chad and Uganda in
exchange for business advantages for CEFC China, a Shanghai-based multibillion-dollar conglomerate that operates internationally in multiple
sectors, including oil, gas, and banking. During the course of the schemes, Ho served as the secretary-general of a non-governmental
organization based in Hong Kong and Arlington, Virginia, and registered as a charitable entity in the United States, the China Energy Fund
Committee (âCEFC NGOâ), which held âSpecial Consultative Statusâ with the United Nations (UN) Economic and Social Council. CEFC NGO was
funded by CEFC China.

In the first scheme (the Chad Scheme), Ho, on behalf of CEFC China, offered a $2 million cash bribe, hidden within gift boxes, to Idriss DÃ©by, the
president of Chad, in an effort to obtain valuable oil rights from the Chadian government. In the second scheme (the Uganda Scheme), Ho
caused a $500,000 bribe to be paid, via wires transmitted through New York, New York, to an account designated by Sam Kutesa, the Minister
of Foreign Affairs of Uganda, who had recently completed his term as the president of the UN General Assembly. Ho also schemed to pay a
$500,000 cash bribe to Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, and offered to provide both Kutesa and Museveni with additional corrupt
benefits by âpartneringâ with them and their families in future joint ventures in Uganda.

The Chad Scheme

The Chad Scheme began in or about September 2014 when Ho flew into New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly. At that time,
CEFC China - a multibillion-dollar energy company based in Shanghai, China - was working to expand its operations to Chad, and wanted to
meet with President DÃ©by as quickly as possible. Through a connection, Ho was introduced to Cheikh Gadio, the former Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Senegal, who had a personal relationship with President DÃ©by. Ho and Gadio met at CEFC China's suite at Trump World Tower in

midtown Manhattan, where Ho enlisted Gadio to assist CEFC China in obtaining access to President DÃ©by

Gadio connected Ho and CEFC China to President DÃ©by. In an initial meeting in Chad in November 2014, President DÃ©by described to Ho and
CEFC China executives certain lucrative oil rights that were available for CEFC China to acquire. Following that meeting, Gadio advised Ho and
CEFC China to send a technical team to Chad to investigate the oil rights and make an offer to President DÃ©by grounded in factual data.
Instead, Ho insisted on a prompt second meeting with President DÃ©by. The second meeting took place a few weeks later, in December 2014.
Ho led a CEFC China delegation, which flew to Chad on a corporate jet with $2 million cash concealed within several gift boxes. At the
conclusion of a business meeting with President DÃ©by, Ho and the CEFC China executives presented him with the gift boxes.

To the surprise of Ho and the CEFC China executives, President DÃ©by rejected the $2 million bribe offer, but later agreed to accept the money
as a charitable donation to the country. Ho subsequently drafted a letter to President DÃ©by falsely claiming that the cash had really been
intended as a donation to the people of Chad all along.

Ho and CEFC China did not obtain the unfair advantage that they had sought through the bribe offer, and by mid-2015, Ho had turned his
attention to a different so-called âgateway to Africaâ: Uganda.

The Uganda Scheme

The Uganda Scheme began around the same time as the Chad Scheme, when Ho was in New York for the annual UN General Assembly. Ho met
with Sam Kutesa, who had recently begun his term as the 69th president of the UN General Assembly (âPGAâ). Ho, purporting to act on behalf
of CEFC NGO, met with Kutesa and began to cultivate a relationship with him. During the year when Kutesa served as PGA, Ho and Kutesa
discussed a âstrategic partnershipâ between Uganda and CEFC China for various business ventures, to be formed once Kutesa returned to
Uganda.

In or about February 2016 - after Kutesa had returned to Uganda and resumed his role as Foreign Minister, and Yoweri Museveni (Kutesaâs
relative) had been reelected as the president of Uganda - Kutesa solicited a payment from Ho, purportedly for a charitable foundation that
Kutesa wished to launch. Ho agreed to provide the requested payment, but simultaneously requested, on behalf of CEFC China, an invitation to
Museveni's inauguration, business meetings with Museveni and other high-level Ugandan officials, and a list of specific business projects in
Uganda in which CEFC China could participate.

In May 2016, Ho and CEFC China executives traveled to Uganda. Prior to departing, Ho caused CEFC NGO to wire $500,000 to the account
provided by Kutesa in the name of the so-called âfoundation,â which wire was transmitted through New York, New York. Ho also advised his
boss, Ye Jianming, the then-chairman of CEFC China, to provide $500,000 in cash to Museveni, ostensibly as a campaign donation, even though
Museveni had already been reelected. Ho intended these payments to influence Kutesa and Museveni to use their official power to steer
business advantages to CEFC China.

Ho and CEFC China executives attended President Museveniâs inauguration and obtained business meetings in Uganda with Museveni and top
Ugandan officials, including with the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources. After the trip, Ho requested that Kutesa and Museveni assist
CEFC China in acquiring a Ugandan bank, as an initial step before pursuing additional ventures in Uganda. Ho also offered to âpartnerâ with
Kutesa and Museveni and/or their âfamily businesses,â making clear that both officials would share in CEFC Chinaâs future profits. In exchange
for the bribes offered and paid by Ho, Kutesa thereafter steered a bank acquisition opportunity to CEFC China.

The investigation was conducted by the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations and the Department of Justice, Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance.

Trial Attorney Paul A. Hayden of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, FCPA Unit and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Douglas S.
Zolkind, and Catherine E. Ghosh of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for Southern District of New Yorkâs Public Corruption Unit are prosecuting the case.

Former Executive Managing Director of Och-Ziff Capital Management Indicted for Defrauding
Client and Obstruction of Justice

Former Hedge Fund Executive Sought to Defraud Charitable Foundation and Cover Up Fraudulent Self-
Dealing from Federal Investigators

A former executive managing director of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (Och-Ziff), a New York-based
hedge fund, was charged in an indictment unsealed today for his alleged participation in a scheme to defraud one
of the hedge fundâs clients, a large charitable foundation, when recommending financial investments relating to the
African mining sector.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S.
Attorney Bridget M. Rohde of the Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr.
of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Special Agent in Charge James D. Robnett of the Internal Revenue Service-
Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-CI) New York office made the announcement.

Michael Leslie Cohen, 46, of London, England was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit investment
adviser fraud, one count of investment adviser fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, four counts of
wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice, one count of obstruction of justice and one count of making
false statements. The indictment was returned under seal by a federal grand jury sitting in Brooklyn, New York on
Oct. 5, 2017, and relates to Cohenâs alleged conduct between 2008 and 2013.

The indictment alleges that, beginning in or about 2008, Cohen and his co-conspirators carried out a scheme to
defraud an Och-Ziff client, a large charitable foundation. According to the indictment, Cohen violated his fiduciary
duties to the charitable foundation by making material misrepresentations and concealing conflicts of interest in
connection with a proposed investment in an African mining company. The indictment alleges, among other things,
that Cohen failed to disclose to the charitable foundation that one of the sellers of the African mining company
shares owed Cohen millions of dollars on a delinquent $18 million personal loan that Cohen had made to the seller
to finance the purchase of a luxury yacht. The seller allegedly paid approximately $4 million of the African mining
company share proceeds to Cohen in repayment of the personal yacht loan. Cohen did not disclose to the
charitable foundation that he had a personal interest in the African mining company and that a portion of shares he
controlled would be sold as part of the transaction, the indictment alleges.

In addition, the indictment alleges that in order to conceal his fraudulent scheme and self-dealing, Cohen conspired
with others to cover up facts about the transaction after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began
investigating Och-Ziff in 2011. Cohen and others allegedly engaged in a number of acts to obstruct investigations,
including concocting a false, backdated letter and making false statements to federal agents and the SEC.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The FBIâs New York Field Office and IRS-CIâs New York office are investigating the case. Trial Attorney Gerald M.
Moody Jr. of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David C. Pitluck, James P.
McDonald, a former Fraud Section trial attorney, and Jonathan P. Lax of the Eastern District of New York are
prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this
matter. The Department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SECâs Boston
Regional Office in this matter.

Chairman of a Macau Real Estate Development Company Convicted on All Counts for Role in
Scheme to Bribe United Nations Ambassadors to Build a Multi-Billion Dollar Conference Center

Yesterday, a federal jury convicted the chairman of a real estate development company for his role in a scheme to bribe United Nations
ambassadors to obtain support to build a conference center in Macau that would host, among other events, the annual United Nations Global
South-South Development Expo.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim of the
Southern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney, Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Chief Don Fort of
Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) made the announcement.

After a four week trial, Ng Lap Seng, a/k/a âDavid Ng,â 69, of Macau, China, was convicted of two counts of violating the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, one count of paying bribes and gratuities, one count of money laundering and two counts of conspiracy. No sentencing date has
been set.

âThe defendantâs corrupt activities were all the more egregious and shameful as he tried to hide his bribes as philanthropy,â said Acting
Assistant Attorney General Blanco. âCorruption is a disease that has a corrosive effect on the rule of law everywhere and harms good people
throughout the world. The Department is steadfast in its mission to aggressively investigate and prosecute bribery in all its forms, and
vigorously protect the rule of law.â

âIn his unbridled pursuit of even greater personal fortune, billionaire Ng Lap Seng corrupted the highest levels of the United Nations,â said
Acting U.S. Attorney Kim. âThrough bribes and no show jobs, Ng turned leaders of the league of nations into his private band of profiteers. Ngâs
journey from a Macau real estate mogul to convicted felon should serve as a cautionary tale to all tempted to follow his path. If you bring
corruption to New York - whether to the State Capitol in Albany or to the halls of the U.N. General Assembly - your journey may very well end in
a Manhattan federal courtroom, with a unanimous jury announcing your guilt.â

âNgâs bribery scheme began at the intersection where business and intergovernmental matters overlap,â said Assistant Director in Charge
Sweeney, Jr. He may have thought this was a good place to start, but itâs doubtful this was the ending he had in mind. This case is nothing more
than an example of corruption in its purest form, and weâve proven once again that no individual or organization is powerful enough to be
immune from prosecution.â

âToday's conviction is a result of untangling a global labyrinth of complex financial transactions used by Ng to facilitate bribes to foreign
officials,â said Chief Fort. âIRS-Cl has become a trusted leader in pursuit of those who use corruption as their business model to circumvent the
law. Cl is committed to maintaining fair competition, free of corrupt practices, through a dynamic synthesis of global teamwork and our robust
financial investigative talents.â

According to the evidence presented at trial, Ng, the chairman of the Sun Kian Ip Group, conspired with and paid bribes to Francis Lorenzo, a
former UN Ambassador from the Dominican Republic, and John W. Ashe, the late former Permanent Representative of Antigua and Barbuda to
the UN and the 68th President of the UN General Assembly (âUNGAâ). With the assistance of Jeff C. Yin, an accountant and co-conspirator who
worked with Ng and others and previously pleaded guilty, Ng orchestrated a scheme with the principal objective of obtaining the formal support
of the UN for a multi-billion dollar facility that Ng hoped to build in Macau using the Sun Kian Ip Group (the âMacau Conference Centerâ). Ng
wanted the Macau Conference Center to serve as a location for meetings, discussions, forums, and other events associated with the UN. In
particular, he wanted it to serve as the permanent home of the annual âGlobal South-South Development Expo,â which is run by the UN Office
for South-South Cooperation, and is hosted in a different country or city every year.

The trial evidence further showed that Ng bribed Ambassador Ashe and Ambassador Lorenzo (together, the âAmbassadorsâ) in exchange for
their agreement to use their official positions to advance Ngâs interest in obtaining formal UN support for the Macau Conference Center. As the
evidence demonstrated at trial, Ng paid the Ambassadors in a variety of forms. For example, Ng appointed Ambassador Lorenzo as the
President of South-South News, a New York-based organization â funded by Ng â which described itself as a media platform dedicated to
advancing the implementation of the UNâs Millennium Development Goals, a set of philanthropic goals. Ng provided bribe payments to
Ambassador Lorenzo through South-South News by transmitting payments from Macau to a company in the Dominican Republic affiliated with
Ambassador Lorenzoâs brother (the âDominican Companyâ). Through South-South News, Ng also made payments to Ambassador Ashe,
including to Ambassador Asheâs wife, who was paid in her capacity as a âconsultantâ to South-South News, and to an account that Ambassador
Ashe had established, purportedly to raise money for his role as President of UNGA. Ng also provided bribes through cash and wire payments to
the Ambassadors.

According to the trial evidence, one of the actions that the Ambassadors took in exchange for bribe payments, to advance Ngâs objectives, was
to submit an official document to the then-UN Secretary-General in support of the Macau Conference Center (the âUN Documentâ). The UN
Document claimed that there was a need to build the Macau Conference Center to support the UNâs global development goals. Ambassador
Ashe, aided by Ambassador Lorenzo, initially submitted the UN Document to the UNGA in or about late February 2012. More than a year later,
at Ngâs behest, the Ambassadors revised the UN Document to refer specifically to Ngâs company, the Sun Kian Ip Group, as a partner in the
Macau Conference Center project. The UN Document requested that the Secretary-General circulate the UN Document âas a document of the
sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly,â under a specific item of the official UNGA agenda. The Secretary-General followed this request,
thereby making the UN Document an official part of the UNGA record.
Five other defendants have been charged in this matter. Co-conspirators Lorenzo, Yin and Heidi Hong Piao have pleaded guilty and are awaiting
sentencing. Shiwei Yan has pleaded and was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Co-defendant Ashe passed away in 2016 and the charges
against him were dismissed.

This case was investigated by the FBI and IRS-ClI. Trial Attorney David A. Last of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Daniel C. Richenthal, Janis M. Echenberg and Douglas S. Zolkind of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

Five Former Venezuelan Government Officials Charged in Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Foreign Bribery

Charges were unsealed today against five former Venezuelan government officials for their alleged participation in an international money
laundering scheme involving bribes made to corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy
company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Two of the five defendants are also charged with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Houston made the announcement.

Four of the defendants, Luis Carlos De Leon Perez (De Leon), 41; Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 50; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 50; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39, were arrested in Spain in October 2017 by Spanish authorities on arrest
warrants based on a 20-count indictment returned in the Southern District of Texas on Aug. 23, 2017. Cesar Rincon was extradited from Spain
on Feb. 9, and made his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge MJ Stephen Smith of the Southern District of Texas. De Leon,
Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spanish custody pending extradition. A fifth defendant, Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33, remains at large.
All five defendants are citizens of Venezuela; De Leon is also a U.S. citizen.

De Leon, Villalobos, Reiter and Isturiz are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Cesar Rincon is charged
with two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each of the defendants is charged with one or more counts of money laundering,
as follows: De Leon, Cesar Rincon and Reiter, four counts each; Villalobos, one count; and Isturiz, five counts. De Leon and Villalobos are also
each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.

âCorruption threatens economic and political stability, and victimizes ordinary law-abiding people by diverting public funds into the pockets of
corrupt officials and bribe payers,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âThe charges announced today demonstrate our
commitment to fighting corruption at its source and to prosecuting those who allegedly launder their illicit gains through American financial
institutions and real estate. Through cases like this, we are sending a strong message to corrupt foreign officials: if you launder your ill-gotten
gains through the United States, you will be prosecuted.â

âEffective deterrence of corruption requires prosecution of culpable individuals, wherever those individuals are located,â said U.S. Attorney
Patrick. âWe will continue to enforce the FCPA against those that avail themselves of the privileges of the American marketplace.â

âThis case is an example of what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to thwart complex cross-
border crimesâ said Special Agent in Charge Dawson. âHSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would
participate in illegal practices.

The indictment alleges that the five defendants, all of whom were then-current officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other
Venezuelan government agencies or instrumentalities, were known as the âmanagement teamâ and wielded significant influence within PDVSA.
According to the indictment, the management team conspired with each other and others to solicit several PDVSA vendors, including vendors
who were residents of the United States, and who owned and controlled businesses incorporated and based in the United States, for bribes and
kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with their PDVSA business. The indictment further alleges that
the co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of the bribery scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions,
including to, from or through bank accounts in the United States, and, in some instances, laundered the bribe proceeds in the form of real
estate transactions and other investments in the United States.

According to the indictment, two PDVSA vendors, Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and
Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 54, of Coral Gables, Florida, sent over $27 million in bribe payments to an account in Switzerland for
which De Leon was a beneficial owner and De Leon and Villalobos were authorized signers. The indictment alleges that those funds were later
transferred to other accounts in Switzerland. Both Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to
FCPA charges in connection with a scheme to bribe PDVSA officials. According to admissions made in connection with their pleas, Roberto
Rincon and Shiera paid bribes and provided other things of value to PDVSA officials to ensure that their companies were placed on PDVSA
bidding panels and ensure that they were given payment priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding
invoices. Roberto Rincon and Shiera are currently awaiting sentencing.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

With the unsealing of the indictment today, the Justice Department has announced charges against 15 individuals, 10 of whom have pleaded
guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing
investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys
Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney
Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District
of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

Micronesian Government Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Scheme Involving FCPA
Violations

A Micronesian government official pleaded guilty yesterday to a money laundering charge involving bribes made to corruptly secure
engineering and project management contracts from the government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), in violation of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and
Special Agent in Charge Sean Kaul of the FBIâs Honolulu Field Office.

Master Halbert, 44, a Micronesian citizen, pleaded guilty in Honolulu before U.S. District Judge Susan O. Mollway of the District of Hawaii to a
one-count information charging him with conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 29, 2019 by Judge
Mollway.

According to his admissions at the plea hearing, Halbert was a government official in the FSM Department of Transportation, Communications
and Infrastructure who administered FSMâs aviation programs, including the management of its airports. Halbert admitted that between 2006
and 2016, a Hawaii-based engineering and consulting company owned by Frank James Lyon paid bribes to FSM officials, including Halbert, to
obtain and retain contracts with the FSM government valued at nearly $8 million, in violation of the FCPA. Lyon and Halbert agreed that these
bribe payments would be transported from the United States to the FSM.

In a related matter, Lyon, 53, of Honolulu, Hawaii, pleaded guilty on Jan. 22 to a one-count information filed in the District of Hawaii charging
him with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and to commit federal program fraud. Lyon is scheduled to be sentenced
on May 13.

Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International
Affairs and the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General provided significant assistance.

Former Venezuelan Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charge in Connection with Bribery
Scheme

A dual U.S.-Venezuelan citizen pleaded guilty today for his role in a scheme to bribe officials of Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled
energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), and for his role in an international money laundering scheme involving the bribes paid
by the owners of U.S.-based companies to Venezuelan government officials to corruptly secure energy contracts and payment priority on
outstanding invoices.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs (ICE) Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Luis Carlos De Leon-Perez (De Leon), 42, a citizen of the United States and Venezuela previously residing in Spain, pleaded guilty today in
federal court in Houston to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one count of conspiracy to commit
money laundering. U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt of the Southern District of Texas accepted De Leonâs plea. Sentencing is scheduled for
Sept. 24.

De Leon was arrested in Spain in October 2017 and subsequently extradited to the United States after a federal grand jury in the Southern
District of Texas returned a 20-count indictment against him and Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 51; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 51; Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39.

According to admissions made in connection with De Leonâs plea, between 2011 and 2013, he conspired with Villalobos, Cesar Rincon, Isturiz
and others, all of whom were then officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other Venezuelan government agencies or
instrumentalities, to solicit PDVSA vendors for bribes and kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with
their PDVSA business. Specifically, De Leon admitted that he solicited and directed bribes from Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto
Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 55, of Coral Gables, Florida, to PDVSA officials in order to
assist Roberto Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies, including their U.S.-based companies, in receiving payment priority and receiving additional
PDVSA contracts. De Leon further admitted that he then conspired with Roberto Rincon and Shiera to launder and conceal the proceeds of the
bribery scheme through a series of financial transactions, including wire transfers to accounts in Switzerland held in the names of individuals or
entities other than De Leon and his co-conspirators.

As part of his plea agreement, De Leon also admitted to soliciting bribes from other owners of energy companies based in the United States and
elsewhere, and directing a portion of such bribes to PDVSA officials in order to assist those individuals and their companies in winning business
with PDVSA and to obtain payment from PDVSA on outstanding invoices ahead of other PDVSA vendors.

Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to charges under the FCPA for their respective roles in the
bribery scheme. Cesar Rincon previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. They currently await
sentencing.

The charges against Villalobos, Isturiz and Reiter remain pending. Each of the three remaining defendants is charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering and with one or more counts of money laundering. Villalobos is also charged with one count of
conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spain pending extradition and Isturiz remains at large.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

De Leon is the latest individual to plead guilty as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. Including
De Leon, Cesar Rincon, Roberto Rincon and Shiera, the Justice Department has announced the guilty pleas of a total of 12 individuals in
connection with the investigation.

HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service
Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys John P. Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine
Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

assistance.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Agrees to Pay More Than $283 Million to Resolve Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act Charges

Companies Agree to Pay Nearly $520 Million to U.S. Criminal and Regulatory Authorities, Representing the
Largest Criminal Fine Imposed Against a Pharmaceutical Company for Violations of the FCPA

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva), the worldâs largest manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products, and its wholly-owned Russian
subsidiary, Teva LLC (Teva Russia), agreed to resolve criminal charges and to pay a criminal penalty of more than $283 million in connection
with schemes involving the bribery of government officials in Russia, Ukraine and Mexico in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the FBI's
Criminal Investigative Division, and Assistant Special Agent in Charge William J. Maddalena of the FBIâs Miami Field Office made the
announcement.

âTeva and its subsidiaries paid millions of dollars in bribes to government officials in various countries, and intentionally failed to implement a
system of internal controls that would prevent bribery,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âCompanies that compete fairly, ethically and
honestly deserve a level playing field, and we will continue to prosecute those who undermine that goal.â

âNo matter where corruption occurs, the FBI and our global partners are committed to diligently rooting out the corruption that betrays the
public trust and threatens a fair economy for all,â said FBI Assistant Director Stephen Richardson.

âAs demonstrated by this case, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a long reach,â said William J]. Maddalena, Assistant Special Agent in
Charge, FBI Miami. âTeva's egregious attempt to enrich themselves failed and they will now pay a tough penalty.â

According to the companiesâ admissions, Teva executives and Teva Russia employees paid bribes to a high-ranking Russian government official
intending to influence the official to use his authority to increase sales of Tevaâs multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone, in annual drug purchase
auctions held by the Russian Ministry of Health. The corrupt arrangement occurred at the same time that the Russian government was seeking
to reduce the amount spent on costly foreign pharmaceutical products, such as Copaxone. Between 2010 and at least 2012, pursuant to an
agreement with a repackaging and distribution company owned by the Russian government official, Teva earned more than $200 million in
profits on Copaxone sales to the Russian government. Moreover, the Russian official earned approximately $65 million in corrupt profits
through inflated profit margins granted to the officialâs company.

Teva also admitted to paying bribes to a senior government official within the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to influence the Ukrainian
governmentâs approval of Teva drug registrations, which were necessary for the company to market and sell its products in the country.
Between 2001 and 2011, Teva engaged the official as the companyâs âregistration consultant,â paid him a monthly fee and provided him with
travel and other things of value totaling approximately $200,000. In exchange, the official used his official position and influence within the
Ukrainian government to influence the registration in Ukraine of Teva pharmaceutical products, including Copaxone and insulins.

In addition, Teva admitted that it failed to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls and failed to enforce the controls it
had in place at its Mexican subsidiary, which allowed bribes to be paid by the subsidiary to doctors employed by the Mexican government. Teva
admitted that its Mexican subsidiary had been bribing these doctors to prescribe Copaxone since at least 2005. Teva executives in Israel
responsible for the development of the companyâs anti-corruption compliance program in 2009 had been aware of the bribes paid to
government doctors in Mexico. Nevertheless, Teva executives approved policies and procedures that they knew were not sufficient to meet the
risks posed by Tevaâs business and were not adequate to prevent or detect payments to foreign officials. Teva also admitted that its executives
put in place managers to oversee the compliance function who were unable or unwilling to enforce the anti-corruption policies that had been
put in place.

Teva entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in connection with a criminal information, filed today in the Southern District of
Florida, charging the company with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of failing to
implement adequate internal controls. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, Teva will pay a total criminal penalty of $283,177,348.
Teva also agreed to continue to cooperate with the departmentâs investigation, enhance its compliance program, implement rigorous internal
controls and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for a term of three years.

Teva Russia has signed a plea agreement in which it has agreed to plead guilty to a one-count criminal information, also filed today in the
Southern District of Florida, charging the company with conspiring to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The plea agreement is
subject to court approval. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams of the Southern District of Florida and Teva
Russia's initial court appearance has been scheduled for January 12, 2017.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Teva, whereby the company
agreed to pay approximately $236 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined total amount of U.S.
criminal and regulatory penalties to be paid by Teva is nearly $520 million.
The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including the fact that Teva did not timely
voluntarily self-disclose the conduct, but did cooperate with the departmentâs investigation after the SEC served it with a subpoena. Teva
received a 20 percent discount off the low end of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of its substantial cooperation and
remediation. The company, however, did not receive full cooperation credit because of issues that resulted in delays to the early stages of the
Fraud Sectionâs investigation, including vastly overbroad assertions of attorney-client privilege and not producing documents on a timely basis
in response to certain Fraud Section document requests. Because many of the companyâs compliance enhancements were more recent, and
therefore have not been tested, the DPA imposes an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years.

The FBI's International Corruption Unit and Miami Field Office investigated the case. Fraud Section Trial Attorneys Rohan A. Virginkar and John-
Alex Romano prosecuted the case. The Fraud Section appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC in this
matter. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs and the Mexican Attorney Generalâs Office (Procuradura General de la Republica or
PGR) also provided assistance in this matter.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Four Individuals Charged for Alleged Involvement in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving $800
Million International Real Estate Deal

Court documents were unsealed today charging four individuals for their roles in a scheme to pay $2.5 million in
bribes to facilitate the $800 million sale of a commercial building in Vietnam to a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth
fund.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara of the Southern District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs
New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThis alleged conduct proves the adage that there is truly no honor among thieves,â said Assistant Attorney General
Caldwell. âThe indictment alleges that two defendants wanted to bribe a government official; instead they were
defrauded by their co-defendant. Todayâs charges are another example of the Criminal Divisionâs commitment to
rooting out all manner of corruption.â

âThe father-son defendants, Ban Ki Sang and Joo Hyun Bahn, allegedly conspired to bribe a foreign official to close
an $800 million deal for a 72-story skyscraper in Vietnam, a deal that would have led to a multimillion-dollar
commission for the Manhattan real estate broker son and much needed capital for the fatherâs construction
company in Korea,â said U.S. Attorney Bharara. âBut these alleged schemers were themselves double-crossed, as
the man who purportedly set up the bribery scheme, Malcolm Harris, took the bribe money and pocketed it. This
alleged bribery and fraud scheme offends all who believe in honest and transparent business, and it stands as a
reminder that those who bring international corruption to New York City, as alleged here, will face the scrutiny of
American law enforcement.â

âWhen Ban, a senior executive at Landmark 72, realized the debts owed to his companyâs creditors were mounting,
he sought the support of his son Bahn, a broker for a real estate firm in Manhattan,â said Assistant Director in
Charge Sweeney. âThe plan was for Bahn to secure an investor for Landmark 72, and the brokerage agreement
they entered into would ultimately secure Bahn a lucrative profit. But instead of lawfully obtaining financing for the
deal, they allegedly entered into an illegal agreement with Harris to bribe a foreign official into purchasing the
property. In the end, they were hoodwinked by their very own criminal activity.â

Joo Hyun Bahn, aka Dennis Bahn, 38, of Tenafly, New Jersey, and his father, Ban Ki Sang (Ban), 69, of Seoul, South
Korea, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), three
counts of violating the FCPA, one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of money
laundering. In addition, Bahn and Malcolm Harris, 52, of New York City, are each charged with one count of wire
fraud, one count of conducting monetary transactions in illegal funds and aggravated identity theft. San Woo, aka
John Woo, 35, of Edgewater, New Jersey, was charged separately by complaint with one count of conspiracy to
violate the FCPA. Bahn was arrested in Tenafly earlier this morning, and Woo was arrested at JFK Airport. Bahn and
Woo are expected to be presented later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Nathaniel Fox of the Southern
District of New York. Ban and Harris remain at large.

According to the indictment and the complaint, from in or about March 2013 through in or about May 2015, Ban
was a senior executive at Keangnam Enterprises Co. Ltd. (Keangnam), a South Korean construction company that
built and owned Landmark 72, a building complex in Hanoi, Vietnam. In early 2013, Keangnam was experiencing a
liquidity crisis; the debts owed to the companyâs creditors were maturing and Keangnam needed to raise capital.
Ban allegedly convinced Keangnam to hire his son Bahn to secure an investor for Landmark 72. Thereafter,
Keangnam entered into an exclusive brokerage agreement with Bahn, who worked as a broker at a commercial real
estate firm in New York City, and his firm. Pursuant to the agreement, Bahn stood to earn a multimillion-dollar
commission from Keangnam if he was successful in securing an investor.

Instead of obtaining financing through legitimate channels, Bahn and Ban allegedly conspired to pay bribes to a
foreign official of a Middle Eastern country, in order to induce the official to use his influence to convince his
countryâs sovereign wealth fund to acquire Landmark 72 for approximately $800 million. Harris, who held himself
out as an agent of the foreign official despite not actually having such a relationship, allegedly deceived Bahn and
Ban by sending numerous emails that were purportedly sent by the foreign official. According to the indictment, in
or about April 2014, Bahn and Ban agreed to pay, through Harris, $2.5 million in bribes to the official, including
$500,000 upfront and $2 million upon the close of the sale of Landmark 72. Woo helped Bahn and Ban obtain the
$500,000 that was used as the upfront bribe payment. Bahn and Ban arranged the transfer of the $500,000 to
Harris for him to pay to the foreign official, unaware that Harris did not have the relationship he claimed with the
foreign official. Instead, Harris stole the $500,000, spending the money on lavish personal expenses, including rent
for a luxury penthouse apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

According to the indictment, over the course of 2014 and 2015, Keangnamâs liquidity crisis worsened. Believing
that the planned bribery would result in the sale of Landmark 72, and not wanting to lose his commission, Bahn
allegedly engaged in a fraudulent scheme to trick Keangnam and its creditors into believing the sovereign wealth
fund was close to acquiring Landmark 72. In furtherance of the fraudulent scheme, Bahn repeatedly lied to
Keangnam and its creditors about the status of the Landmark 72 deal, knowing that Keangnam and its creditors
would rely upon the misrepresentations. In addition, Bahn forged emails from the foreign official and other
documents to make the sale of Landmark 72 to the sovereign wealth fund appear imminent to Keangnam and its
creditors. Ultimately, when the sale of Landmark 72 to the sovereign wealth fund failed to materialize, Keangnam
was forced to enter court receivership in South Korea. Bahn is also alleged to have stolen approximately $225,000
of the $500,000 that Keangnam had advanced Bahnâs firm to cover brokerage expenses.

The charges contained in the indictment and the complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

FBIâs New York Field Office International Corruption Squad investigated the case. The Department of Justiceâs
Office of International Affairs is providing assistance in this investigation. Trial Attorney Dennis R. Kihm of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Noble of the Southern District of New Yorkâs
Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit are prosecuting the case.

Oil Executives Plead Guilty for Roles in Bribery Scheme Involving Foreign Officials

The former CEO and chief operations officer (COO) of a Monaco-based intermediary company have pleaded guilty for their roles in a scheme to
corruptly facilitate millions of dollars in bribe payments to officials in multiple countries. These included Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Irag, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria. The companyâs former business development director also pleaded guilty
for his role in paying bribes in Libya.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas, Assistant Director in Charge Timothy R. Slater of the FBIâs Washington Field Office, Inspector in Charge Adrian Gonzales of the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Houston Division and Special Agent in Charge D. Richard Goss of the IRS-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl)
Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Cyrus Ahsani, 51, and Saman Ahsani, 46, both of United Kingdom (UK), each pleaded guilty March 25 to one count of conspiracy to violate the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), for conspiring to facilitate bribes on behalf of companies in foreign countries in order to secure oil and gas
contracts. UK resident Steven Hunter, 50, former business development director, pleaded guilty Aug. 2, 2018, to one count of conspiracy to
violate the FCPA. Cyrus and Saman Ahsani are set for sentencing April 20, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore of the Southern
District of Texas. Hunterâs sentencing is scheduled for March 13, 2020, before U.S. District Judge David Hittner.

According to court documents, former U.S. resident and CEO Cyrus Ahsani and former COO Saman Ahsani managed a Monaco-based
intermediary company that provided services for multinational companies operating in the energy sector. From approximately 1999 to 2016,
the Ahsanis conspired with others, including multiple companies and individuals, to make millions of dollars in bribe payments to government
officials in Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Irag, Kazakhstan, Libya and Syria.

Additionally, court documents reflect Cyrus and Saman Ahsani laundered the proceeds of their bribery scheme in order to promote and conceal
the schemes and to cause the destruction of evidence in order to obstruct investigations in the United States and elsewhere. Hunter
participated in the conspiracy to violate the FCPA by, among other things, facilitating bribe payments to Libyan officials between about 2009
and 2015.

The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation and U.S. Postal Inspection Service conducted the investigation. Trial Attorneys Dennis R. Kihm, Gerald M.
Moody Jr., Jonathan P. Robell and Gwendolyn A. Stamper of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Suzanne Elmilady
of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided substantial
assistance in this matter.

The governments of Australia, Canada, France, Guernsey, Italy, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland and UK provided significant
assistance in this matter as did the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Eurojust.

August 2018 and remains charged in the superseding indictment as a co-conspirator in the same money laundering conspiracy and money
laundering counts. He is currently a fugitive residing in Venezuela.

The superseding indictment alleges that Gorrin paid millions of dollars in bribes to two former Venezuelan national treasurers, Alejandro
Andrade Cedeno (Andrade) and Diaz, and to Velasquez, for the benefit of Diaz, to corruptly secure the rights to conduct foreign currency
exchange transactions for the Venezuelan government at favorable rates. Gorrin wired money to and for the benefit of Andrade and Diaz,
including money for private jets, yachts, homes, champion horses, high-end watches, and a fashion line.

Andrade, 56, a Venezuelan citizen, was previously sentenced to 10 years in prison in November 2018 for his role in the conspiracy to commit
money laundering. As part of his guilty plea, Andrade admitted that he received over $1 billion in bribes from co-conspirator Gorrin and other
co-conspirators in exchange for using his position as Venezuelan national treasurer to select them to conduct currency exchange transactions at
favorable rates for the Venezuelan government.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Vanessa Sisti and Trial Attorney Paul A. Hayden of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kurt Lunkenheimer and

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, January 6, 2015

Former Owner and President of Pennsylvania Consulting Companies Charged with Foreign Bribery

The former owner and President of Chestnut Consulting Group Inc. and Chestnut Consulting Group Co. (generally referred to as the âChestnut
Groupâ) was indicted by a federal grand jury today for his alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to a foreign official in violation of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the Travel Act, and to launder proceeds of those crimes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger of the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania and Special Agent in Charge Edward J. Hanko of the FBIâs Philadelphia Division made the announcement.

âWe are committed to combating foreign corruption, across the globe and across all industries, through enforcement actions and prosecutions
of companies and the individuals who run those companies,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âAs alleged, in this case, the owner and
chief executive of a Pennsylvania financial consulting firm secured hundreds of millions of dollars in business by bribing a European banking
official. He now faces an indictment for corruption in federal court. Bribery of foreign officials undermines the public trust in government and
fair competition in business. The charges returned today reflect the clear message that we will root out corruption and prosecute individuals
who violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âWe will aggressively investigate and prosecute individuals in our district who use corrupt means like bribery to influence foreign officials,â said
U.S. Attorney Memeger. âOur criminal statutes in this arena must be enforced to ensure fair dealing in a competitive global marketplace where
foreign officials often hold significant decision-making authority. The alleged conduct here was particularly reprehensible because it
undermined the legitimacy of a process designed to support businesses for the citizens of developing nations.â

âThis is a great example of the FBIâs ability to successfully coordinate with our international law enforcement partners to tackle corruption,â said
Special Agent in Charge Hanko. âBribery - foreign or domestic - cripples the notion of fair competition in the marketplace.â

Dmitrij Harder, 42, of Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, the former owner and president of the Chestnut Group, was charged with one count of
conspiracy to violate the FCPA and Travel Act, five counts of violating the FCPA, five counts of violating the Travel Act, one count of conspiracy
to commit international money laundering, and two counts of money laundering.

According to allegations in the indictment, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was a multilateral development
bank headquartered in London, England, and was owned by over 60 sovereign nations. Among other things, the EBRD provided financing for
development projects in emerging economies, primarily in Eastern Europe.

According to allegations in the indictment, Harder and others paid bribes for the benefit of a senior official at the EBRD in exchange for
influencing the officialâs actions on applications for financing submitted by the Chestnut Groupâs clients and for directing business to the
Chestnut Group. The EBRD ultimately approved applications for financing from two of the Chestnut Groupâs corporate clients; the first resulted
in the EBRD providing an $85 million investment and a 90 million Euro loan, while the second resulted in a $40 million investment and a $60
million convertible loan. The Chestnut Group allegedly earned approximately $8 million in âsuccess feesâ as a result of the EBRDâs approval of
these two applications.

The indictment alleges that Harder made five payments totaling more than $3.5 million to the sister of the EBRD official, in part as an effort to
conceal the bribes. These payments were allegedly made for purported consulting and other services provided to the Chestnut Group by the
officialâs sister, when in fact she provided no such services. Harder also allegedly participated in creating fake documents to justify these
payments.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The case is being investigated by the FBIâs Philadelphia Division. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs also provided assistance.

The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Leo R. Tsao of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Morgan
of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, February 18, 2020

Former Alstom Executives and Marubeni Executive Charged with Bribing Indonesian Officials

Two former executives of the Indonesian subsidiary of the French power and transportation company Alstom S.A. and a former executive of the
Japanese trading company Marubeni Corporation have been charged in a superseding indictment unsealed today for their alleged participation
in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials in Indonesia.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of
Connecticut and Assistant Director in Charge Paul D. Delacout of the FBIâs Los Angeles Office made the announcement.

Reza Moenaf, 63, the former president of Alstomâs subsidiary in Indonesia; Eko Sulianto, 63, the former director of sales of Alstomâs subsidiary
in Indonesia; and Junji Kusunoki, 57, the former deputy general manager of Marubeniâs Overseas Power Project Department, were each charged
with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Kusunoki was charged with six
counts of violating the FCPA and four counts of money laundering, and Sulianto and Moenaf were each charged with two counts of violating the
FCPA and one count of money laundering.

According to the indictment, the defendants, together with others, paid bribes to officials in Indonesia - including, among others, a high-ranking
member of the Indonesian Parliament and the president of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity
company in Indonesia - in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for Alstomâs subsidiaries
in Connecticut and Indonesia and for Marubeni to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, the
defendants allegedly retained two so-called âconsultantsâ purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of the power company
and its subsidiaries in connection with the Tarahan project. The indictment, however, alleges that the primary purpose for hiring the
consultants was to use the consultants to pay bribes to Indonesian officials.

The first consultant retained by the defendants allegedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his Maryland bank account to be used to
bribe the member of Parliament. The consultant then allegedly transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of
the official. According to court documents, emails between the defendants and their co-conspirators discussed in detail the use of the first
consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project.

The superseding indictment alleges that in the fall of 2003, the defendants and their co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was
not effectively bribing key officials at PLN. One email between Moenaf, Sulianto and their co-conspirators described PLN officialsâ âconcern that
if we have won the job, whether their rewards will still be satisfactory or this agent only give them pocket money and disappear.â In another
email, Moenaf asserted that the consultant âhas no grip on the PLN Tender team at allâ and âis more or less similar to [a] cashier which | feel we
pay too much.â As a result, the co-conspirators allegedly retained a second consultant to more effectively bribe PLN officials. The defendants
and their co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the alleged
purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials, the indictment alleges.

An indictment is merely an accusation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The charges against Moenaf, Sulianto, and Kusunoki are part of a wide-ranging investigation into alleged corrupt practices by employees of
Alstom and Marubeni. Five other individuals, as well as Alstom and Marubeni, have pleaded guilty in the case so far, and Lawrence Hoskins, a
former senior vice president at Alstom, was found guilty on Nov. 6, 2019, following a jury trial, of 11 counts of conspiracy, violating the FCPA,
and money laundering.

The FBI's Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the FBIâs Meriden, Connecticut, Resident Agency. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs assisted in the investigation. Senior Deputy Chief Daniel S. Kahn and Assistant Chief Lorinda Laryea of
the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David E. Novick of the District of Connecticut are prosecuting the case.

The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Indonesia, Switzerland's Office of the
Attorney General, as well as authorities in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

Former Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President of Barbadian Insurance Company
Charged with Laundering Bribes to Former Minister of Industry of Barbados

The former chief executive officer and senior vice president of Insurance Corporation of Barbados Limited (ICBL), a Barbados-based insurance
company, were charged in an indictment unsealed on Jan. 18, with laundering bribes to the former Minister of Industry of Barbados in exchange
for his assistance in securing government contracts for ICBL.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York and Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

Ingrid Innes, 63, a citizen of Canada, and Alex Tasker, 58, a citizen of Barbados, were charged with one count of conspiracy to launder money
and two counts of money laundering in an indictment returned in Aug. 22, 2018, by a federal grand jury sitting in Brooklyn, New York. The
former Minister of Industry of Barbados, Donville Inniss, 52, a U.S. legal permanent resident who resided in Tampa, Florida, and Barbados, was
charged with the same crimes in an indictment unsealed on Aug. 6, 2018, and was also charged as a co-defendant of Innes and Tasker in the
superseding indictment.

The indictment alleges that in 2015 and 2016, Innes, then the chief executive officer of ICBL, and Tasker, then a senior vice president of ICBL,
took part in a scheme to launder into the United States approximately $36,000 in bribes that they paid to Inniss, who at the time was a member
of the Parliament of Barbados and the Minister of Industry, International Business, Commerce and Small Business Development of Barbados. In
exchange for the bribes, Inniss allegedly leveraged his positon as the Minister of Industry to enable ICBL to obtain two government contracts.
According to the allegations, Inniss arranged to receive the bribes through a U.S. bank account in the name of a dental company with an
address in Elmont, New York, in order to conceal the scheme.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

ICBL voluntarily self-disclosed the case and received a declination under the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy. ICBL disgorged $93,940.19 in
illicit profits that it earned from the scheme.

The FBI's New York Field Office and International Corruption Squad is investigating the case. In 2015, the FBI formed International Corruption
Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption.

Trial Attorney Gerald M. Moody Jr. of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sylvia Shweder of the Eastern District of
New York are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, December 3, 2020

Vitol Inc. Agrees to Pay over $135 Million to Resolve Foreign Bribery Case

Vitol Inc. (Vitol), the U.S. affiliate of the Vitol group of companies, which together form one of the largest energy trading firms in the world, has
agreed to pay a combined $135 million to resolve the Justice Departmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
(FCPA) and to resolve a parallel investigation in Brazil.

The resolution arises out of Vitol schemes to pay bribes to officials in Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico. Vitol has also agreed to disgorge more than
$12.7 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a related matter and to pay the CFTC a penalty of $16 million related to
trading activity not covered by the deferred prosecution agreement with the department.

âOver a period of 15 years, Vitol paid millions of dollars in bribes to numerous public officials - in three separate countries - to obtain improper
competitive advantages that resulted in significant illicit profits for the company,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the
Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âTodayâs coordinated resolution with Brazil, along with our first coordinated FCPA resolution with the
CFTC, underscores the departmentâs resolve to hold companies accountable for their crimes while, at the same time, avoiding unnecessarily
duplicative penalties.â

âVitol paid bribes to government officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico to win lucrative business contracts and obtain competitive advantages
to which they were not fairly entitled,â said Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âThe United States
Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York will continue to hold accountable companies and individuals that attempt to defy U.S. law
to the detriment of honest competitors.â

âThis resolution demonstrates the FBI's commitment to investigate foreign corruption and hold accountable those who circumvent laws for
financial gain at the expense of American consumers,â said Assistant Director in Charge Kristi K. Johnson of the FBIâs Los Angeles Field Office.
âWe'll continue to work with our partners to root out corruption, whether it occurs domestically or abroad, to ensure trust on the international
playing field.â

Vitol entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed today in the Eastern
District of New York charging the company with two counts of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The case is assigned
to Senior U.S. District Judge Eric N. Vitaliano.

Pursuant to its agreement with the department, Vitolâs total criminal penalty is $135 million. The department will credit $45 million -
approximately one third of the total criminal penalty - against the amount that Vitol will pay to resolve an investigation by the Brazilian
MinistÃ©rio Publico Federal for conduct related to the companyâs bribery scheme in Brazil.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Vitol Inc. and Vitol S.A., another company within the Vitol group of companies, have agreed to
continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals; to
enhance their compliance programs; and to report to the department on the implementation of their compliance programs.

According to the companyâs admissions and court documents, between 2005 and 2014, Vitol and its co-conspirators paid bribes of more than $8
million to at least four officials at Brazil's state-owned and controlled oil company Petrdleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (Petrobras). Vitol paid
these bribes in exchange for receiving confidential Petrobras pricing and competitor information. Vitol concealed the scheme through the use
of intermediaries and a fictitious company that facilitated the payments to offshore accounts and, ultimately, to the Petrobras officials.

Vitol also admitted that from 2011 to 2014, it bribed at least five other Petrobras officials in exchange for receiving confidential pricing
information that Vitol used to win fuel oil contracts with Petrobras. During that scheme, a consultant acting on behalf of Vitol engaged in back-
channel negotiations with a Houston-based Petrobras official. The parties would then hold staged negotiations, ultimately settling on the pre-
arranged price that allowed for bribes to be paid from Vitol to the Petrobras officials. Several of the co-conspirators communicated using alias
email accounts and code names, including âBatman,â âTiger,â âPhil Collins,â âDolphin,â âPopeye,â and âBeb.â

Vitol also admitted to a second conspiracy to bribe officials in Ecuador and Mexico in order to obtain and retain business in connection with the
purchase and sale of oil products. Between 2015 and July 2020, Vitol agreed to offer and pay more than $2 million in bribes to officials in
Ecuador and Mexico.

In furtherance of this bribery scheme, Vitol and its co-conspirators entered into sham consulting agreements, set up shell companies, created
fake invoices for purported consulting services and used alias email accounts to transfer funds to offshore companies involved in the conspiracy
- all while knowing that the funds, at least in part, would be used to pay bribes to Ecuadorian and Mexican officials.

In related matters, the department recently unsealed charges against a Houston-based former Petrobras official who received bribes in
association with the scheme, and who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering on Feb. 8, 2019, in the Eastern
District of New York. In addition, the department recently unsealed charges against one of the intermediaries involved in the Brazil scheme,
who pleaded guilty on Sept. 22, 2017, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA in connection with a related bribery scheme. Both
individuals are awaiting sentencing. Further, on Sept. 22, 2020, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of New York returned an indictment
against Javier Aguilar, a Vitol trader, for his alleged role in the Ecuador scheme.

The investigation is being conducted by the FBIâs International Corruption Unit. The governmentâs case is being handled by the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York. Fraud Section Trial Attorneys Derek J. Ettinger,
Jonathan P. Robell, and Clayton P. Solomon, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark E. Bini and Andrey Spektor are prosecuting the case. The U.S.
Marshals Service and Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs provided assistance in the investigation.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Two Members of Billion-Dollar Venezuelan Money Laundering Scheme Arrested

Two alleged participants in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA
using Miami, Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes were arrested yesterday and today.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Greenberg of the
Southern District of Florida and Special Agent in Charge Mark Selby of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Miami Field Office made the announcement.

Matthias Krull, 44, a German national and Panamanian resident, and Gustavo Adolfo Hernandez Frieri, 45, a Colombian national and naturalized
U.S. citizen, were charged in a criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The complaint also charged Francisco Convit
Guruceaga, 40; Jose Vincente Amparan Croquer, aka, âChente,â 44; Carmelo Urdaneta Aqui, 44; and Abraham Eduardo Ortega, 51, all
Venezuelan nationals; and Hugo Andre Ramalho Gois, 39, a Portuguese national, and Marcelo Federico Gutierrez Acosta y Lara, 40, a Uruguayan
national, for their alleged participation in the scheme. These defendants remain at large. Krull was arrested last night in Miami and had his
initial court appearance earlier today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes in Miami. Krull is scheduled to have a pre-trial
detention hearing on July 30, and a preliminary hearing on Aug. 8. Frieri was arrested today in Sicily, Italy and faces extradition proceedings.

According to the criminal complaint, the conspiracy in this case allegedly began in December 2014 with a currency exchange scheme that was
designed to embezzle around $600 million from PDVSA, obtained through bribery and fraud, and the defendantsâ efforts to launder a portion of
the proceeds of that scheme. By May 2015, the conspiracy had allegedly doubled in amount to $1.2 billion embezzled from PDVSA. PDVSA is
Venezuelaâs primary source of income and foreign currency (namely, U.S. Dollars and Euros).

The complaint alleges that surrounding and supporting these false-investment laundering schemes are complicit money managers, brokerage
firms, banks and real estate investment firms in the United States and elsewhere, operating as a network of professional money launderers.

The alleged conspirators include former PDVSA officials, professional third-party money launderers, and members of the Venezuelan elite,
sometimes known as âboliburguÃ©s.â

The charges contained in the complaint are merely allegations and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

This case is the result of the ongoing efforts by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) âOperation Money Flight,â a
partnership between and among federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF mission is to identify, investigate and
prosecute high-level members of drug trafficking enterprises, bringing together the combined expertise and unique abilities of federal, state
and local law enforcement.

HSI Miami, HS! London, HSI Rome and HSI Madrid investigated this case. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief David Johnson of the
Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco R. Maderal of the Southern District of Floridaâs International Narcotics
and Money Laundering Section.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance in this matter and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the
National Crime Agency of the United Kingdom and Italian, Spanish and Maltese law enforcement authorities provided assistance. The Fraud
Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

Goldman Sachs Charged in Foreign Bribery Case and Agrees to Pay Over $2.9 Billion

The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (Goldman Sachs or the Company), a global financial institution headquartered in New York, New York, and
Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (GS Malaysia), its Malaysian subsidiary, have admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with a scheme to pay over $1 billion in bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to obtain lucrative
business for Goldman Sachs, including its role in underwriting approximately $6.5 billion in three bond deals for 1Malaysia Development Bhd.
(1MDB), for which the bank earned hundreds of millions in fees. Goldman Sachs will pay more than $2.9 billion as part of a coordinated
resolution with criminal and civil authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and elsewhere.

Goldman Sachs entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed today in the
Eastern District of New York charging the Company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. GS Malaysia pleaded
guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to a one-count criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate the
anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.

Previously, Tim Leissner, the former Southeast Asia Chairman and participating managing director of Goldman Sachs, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng Chong Hwa, also known as âRoger Ng,â former managing director of Goldman and
head of investment banking for GS Malaysia, has been charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng was extradited
from Malaysia to face these charges and is scheduled to stand trial in March 2021. The cases are assigned to U.S. District Judge Margo K.
Brodie of the Eastern District of New York.

In addition to these criminal charges, the department has recovered, or assisted in the recovery of, in excess of $1 billion in assets for Malaysia
associated with and traceable to the 1MDB money laundering and bribery scheme.

âGoldman Sachs today accepted responsibility for its role in a conspiracy to bribe high-ranking foreign officials to obtain lucrative

underwriting and other business relating to 1MDB,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal
Division. âTodayâs resolution, which requires Goldman Sachs to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly three billion dollars in penalties, fines, and
disgorgement, holds the bank accountable for this criminal scheme and demonstrates the departmentâs continuing commitment

to combatting corruption and protecting the U.S. financial system.â

âOver a period of five years, Goldman Sachs participated in a sweeping international corruption scheme, conspiring to avail itself of more than
$1.6 billion in bribes to multiple high-level government officials across several countries so that the company could reap hundreds of millions of
dollars in fees, all to the detriment of the people of Malaysia and the reputation of American financial institutions operating abroad,â said Acting
U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âTodayâs resolution, which includes a criminal guilty plea by Goldman
Sachsâ subsidiary in Malaysia, demonstrates that the department will hold accountable any institution that violates U.S. law anywhere in the
world by unfairly tilting the scales through corrupt practices.â

âWhen government officials and business executives secretly work together behind the scenes for their own illegal benefit, and not that of their
citizens and shareholders, their behavior lends credibility to the narrative that businesses donât succeed based on the quality of their products,
but rather their willingness to play dirty,â said Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office. âGreed
eventually exacts an immense cost on society, and unchecked corrupt behavior erodes trust in public institutions and government entities alike.
This case represents the largest ever penalty paid to U.S. authorities in an FCPA case. Our investigation into the looting of funds from 1MDB
remains ongoing. If anyone has information that could assist the case, call us at 1-800-CALLFBI.â

âIMDB was established to drive strategic initiatives for the long-term economic development of Malaysia. Goldman Sachs admitted today that
one billion dollars of the money earmarked to help the people of Malaysia was actually diverted and used to pay bribes to Malaysian and Abu
Dhabi officials to obtain their business,â said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner of IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Los Angeles Field
Office. âTodayâs guilty pleas demonstrate that the law applies to everyone, including large investment banks like Goldman Sachs. IRS Criminal
Investigation will work tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners to identify and bring to justice those who engage in fraud and deceit
around the globe. When the American financial system is misused for corruption, the IRS will take notice and we will take action.â

According to Goldmanâs admissions and court documents, between approximately 2009 and 2014, Goldman conspired with others to violate the
FCPA by engaging in a scheme to pay more than $1.6 billion in bribes, directly and indirectly, to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi in
order to obtain and retain business for Goldman from 1MDB, a Malaysian state-owned and state-controlled fund created to pursue investment
and development projects for the economic benefit of Malaysia and its people. Specifically, the Company admitted to engaging in the bribery
scheme through certain of its employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng, and a former executive who was a participating managing director
and held leadership positions in Asia (Employee 1), in exchange for lucrative business and other advantages and opportunities. These included,
among other things, securing Goldmanâs role as an advisor on energy acquisitions, as underwriter on three lucrative bond deals with a total
value of $6.5 billion, and a potential role in a highly anticipated and even more lucrative initial public offering for 1MDBâs energy assets. As
Goldman admitted â and as alleged in the indictment pending in the Eastern District of New York against Ng and Low â in furtherance of the
scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired to pay bribes to numerous foreign officials, including high-ranking officials in the
Malaysian government, 1MDB, Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment
Company (IPIC), and Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled joint stock company, Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar).

Goldman admitted today that, in order to effectuate the scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired with Low Taek |ho, aka Jho
Low, to promise and pay over $1.6 billion in bribes to Malaysian, 1MDB, IPIC, and Aabar officials. The co-conspirators allegedly paid these
bribes using more than $2.7 billion in funds that Low, Leissner, and other members of the conspiracy diverted and misappropriated from the
bond offerings underwritten by Goldman. Leissner, Ng and Low also retained a portion of the misappropriated funds for themselves and other
co-conspirators. Goldman admitted that, through Leissner, Ng, Employee 1 and others, the bank used Lowâs connections to advance and
further the bribery scheme, ultimately ensuring that IMDB awarded Goldman a role on three bond transactions between 2012 and 2013, known
internally at Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximus,â and âProject Catalyze.â

Goldman also admitted that, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any transaction involving Low posed
a significant risk, and although they were on notice that Low was involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that
Low was not involved. Goldman further admitted that there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process and afterward â
including but not limited to Lowâs involvement â that either were ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be
approved and Goldman could continue to do business with 1MDB. As a result of the scheme, Goldman received approximately $606 million in
fees and revenue, and increased its stature and presence in Southeast Asia.

Under the terms of the agreements, Goldman will pay a criminal penalty and disgorgement of over $2.9 billion. Goldman also has reached
separate parallel resolutions with foreign authorities in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, and elsewhere, along with domestic
authorities in the United States. The department will credit over $1.6 billion in payments with respect to those resolutions.

The department reached this resolution with Goldman based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily disclose the
conduct to the department; the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included the involvement of high-level employees within the
Companyâs investment bank and others who ignored significant red flags; the involvement of various Goldman subsidiaries across the world;
the amount of the bribes, which totaled over $1.6 billion; the number and high-level nature of the bribe recipients, which included at least 11
foreign officials, including high-ranking officials of the Malaysian government; and the significant amount of actual loss incurred by IMDB as a
result of the co-conspiratorsâ conduct. Goldman received partial credit for its cooperation with the departmentâs investigation, but did not
receive full credit for cooperation because it significantly delayed producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone calls in which the
Companyâs bankers, executives, and control function personnel discussed allegations of bribery and misconduct relating to the conduct in the
statement of facts. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 10 percent reduction off the bottom of the applicable U.S. sentencing
guidelines fine range.

Low has also been indicted for conspiracy to commit money laundering and violate the FCPA, along with Ng, E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 18-CR-538
(MKB). Low remains a fugitive. The charges in the indictment as to Low and Ng are merely allegations, and those defendants are presumed
innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The investigation was conducted by the FBIâs International Corruption Unit and IRS-Cl. The prosecution is being handled by the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys Katherine Nielsen, Nikhila Raj, Jennifer E. Ambuehl, Woo S. Lee, Mary
Ann McCarthy, Leo Tsao, and David Last of the Criminal Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Alixandra Smith and Drew
Rolle of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Additional Criminal Division Trial Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys
within U.S. Attorneyâs Offices for the Eastern District of New York and Central District of California have provided valuable assistance with
various aspects of this investigation, including with civil and criminal forfeitures. The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs of the
Criminal Division provided critical assistance in this case.

The department also appreciates the significant assistance provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the New York State Department of Financial Services, the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, June 20, 2019

Walmart Inc. and Brazil-Based Subsidiary Agree to Pay $137 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act Case

Walmart Inc. (Walmart), a U.S.-based multinational retailer and its wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary, WMT Brasilia S.a.r.l. (WMT Brasilia), have
agreed to pay a combined criminal penalty of $137 million to resolve the governmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA). WMT Brasilia pleaded guilty today in connection with the resolution.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger of the
Eastern District of Virginia, Assistant Director Robert Johnson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Special Agent in Charge Kelly
Jackson of IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Washington, D.C. office made the announcement.

âWalmart profited from rapid international expansion, but in doing so chose not to take necessary steps to avoid corruption,â said Assistant
Attorney General Benczkowski. âIn numerous instances, senior Walmart employees knew of failures of its anti-corruption-related internal
controls involving foreign subsidiaries, and yet Walmart failed for years to implement sufficient controls comporting with U.S. criminal laws. As
todayâs resolution shows, even the largest of U.S. companies operating abroad are bound by U.S. laws, and the Department of Justice will
continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute foreign corruption.â

âWalmart violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act because it failed to implement the internal controls necessary to ferret out corrupt
conduct,â said U.S. Attorney Terwilliger. âFor more than a decade, Walmart experienced exponential international growth but failed to create
safeguards to protect against corruption risks in various countries. This resolution is the result of several years of steadfast work by the
prosecutors and our law enforcement partners at the FBI and IRS-Cl.â

âThe FBI will hold corporations responsible when they turn a blind eye to corruption,"" said FBI Assistant Director Johnson. ""If there is evidence of
violations of FCPA, we will investigate. No corporation, no matter how large, is above the law.""

âWalmartâs guilty plea is another step in IRS-Clâs ongoing effort to pursue corporations that engage in corruption that prevents fair competition
around the world,â said IRS-Cl Special Agent in Charge Jackson. âThrough our efforts, we delved through layers of transactions and uncovered
the bribery of foreign officials. Todayâs announcement is a statement that no company, even one as large as Walmart, is above the law.â

According to Walmartâs admissions, from 2000 until 2011, certain Walmart personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining the
companyâs internal accounting controls related to anti-corruption were aware of certain failures involving these controls, including relating to
potentially improper payments to government officials in certain Walmart foreign subsidiaries, but nevertheless failed to implement sufficient
controls that, among other things, would have ensured: (a) that sufficient anti-corruption-related due diligence was conducted on all third-party
intermediaries (TPIs) who interacted with foreign officials; (b) that sufficient anti-corruption-related internal accounting controls concerning
payments to TPls existed; (c) that proof was required that TPIls had performed services before Walmart paid them; (d) that TPls had written
contracts that included anti-corruption clauses; (e) that donations ostensibly made to foreign government agencies were not converted to
personal use by foreign officials; and (f) that policies covering gifts, travel and entertainment sufficiently addressed giving things of value to
foreign officials and were implemented. Even though senior Walmart personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining the companyâs
internal accounting controls related to anti-corruption knew of these issues, Walmart did not begin to change its internal accounting controls
related to anti-corruption to comply with U.S. criminal laws until 2011.

The internal controls failures allowed Walmart foreign subsidiaries in Mexico, India, Brazil and China to hire TPls without establishing sufficient
controls to prevent those TPls from making improper payments to government officials in order to obtain store permits and licenses. Ina
number of instances, insufficiencies in Walmartâs anti-corruption-related internal accounting controls in these foreign subsidiaries were reported
to senior Walmart employees and executives. The internal control failures allowed the foreign subsidiaries in Mexico, India, Brazil and China to
open stores faster than they would have with sufficient internal accounting controls related to anti-corruption. Consequently, Walmart earned
additional profits through these subsidiaries by opening some of its stores faster.

In Mexico, a former attorney for Walmartâs local subsidiary reported to Walmart in 2005 that he had overseen a scheme for several years prior
in which TPls made improper payments to government officials to obtain permits and licenses for the subsidiary and that several executives at
the subsidiary knew of and approved of the scheme. Most of the TPI invoices included a code specifying why the subsidiary had made the
improper payment, including: (1) avoiding a requirement; (2) influence, control or knowledge of privileged information known by the
government official; and (3) payments to eliminate fines.

In India, because of Walmartâs failure to implement sufficient internal accounting controls related to anti-corruption, from 2009 until 2011,
Walmartâs operations there were able to retain TPls that made improper payments to government officials in order to obtain store operating
permits and licenses. These improper payments were then falsely recorded in Walmartâs joint ventureâs books and records with vague
descriptions like âmisc fees,â âmiscellaneous,â âprofessional fees,â âi

moe moe

incidentalâ and âgovernment fee.â

In Brazil, as a result of Walmartâs failure to implement sufficient internal accounting controls related to anti-corruption at its subsidiary, Walmart
Brazil, despite repeated findings in internal audit reports that such controls were lacking, Walmart Brazil continued to retain and renew
contracts with TPls without conducting the required due diligence. Improper payments were in fact paid by some of these TPIs, including a
construction company that made improper payments to government officials in connection with the construction of two Walmart Brazil stores in
2009 without the knowledge of Walmart Brazil. Walmart Brazil indirectly hired a TPI whose ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly earned
her the nickname âsorceressâ or âgenieâ within Walmart Brazil. Walmart Brazil employees, including a Walmart Brazil executive, knew they
could not hire the intermediary directly because of several red flags. In 2009, the TP! made improper payments to government inspectors in
connection with the construction of a Walmart Brazil store without the knowledge of Walmart Brazil. WMT Brasilia was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Walmart and was a majority-owner of Walmart Brazil, Walmartâs wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, and the majority-owner of retail
stores operating as Walmart Brazil.

In China, Walmartâs local subsidiaryâs internal audit team flagged numerous weaknesses in internal accounting controls related to anti-
corruption at the subsidiary between 2003 and 2011, sometimes repeatedly, but many of these weaknesses were not addressed. In fact, from
2007 until early 2010, Walmart and the subsidiary failed to address nearly all of the anti-corruption-related internal controls audit findings.

Walmart entered into a three-year non-prosecution agreement and agreed to retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for two
years. The $137 million penalty reflects a 20 percent reduction off the bottom of the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range for the
portion of the penalty applicable to conduct in Mexico and 25 percent for the portion applicable to the conduct in Brazil, China and India.
Walmart fully cooperated with the investigation in Brazil, China and India. Walmart cooperated with the investigation in Mexico, but did not
timely provide documents and information to the government and did not de-conflict with the governmentâs request to interview one witness
before Walmart interviewed that witness. Walmart did not voluntarily disclose the conduct in Mexico and only disclosed the conduct in Brazil,
China and India after the government had already begun investigating the Mexico conduct. The $137 million penalty includes forfeiture of $3.6
million and a fine of $724,898 from WMT Brasilia.

In a related resolution with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Walmart agreed to disgorge $144 million in profits.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C. and IRS-Cl are investigating the case. Assistant Chiefs Tarek Helou and Lorinda
Laryea and Trial Attorney Katherine Raut of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jamar Walker of the Eastern
District of Virginia are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs has provided significant assistance by obtaining key evidence in this case, as have public
authorities in, among other countries, Mexico and India.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, November 7, 2017

Five Individuals Charged in Foreign Bribery Scheme Involving Rolls-Royce Plc and Its U.S.
Subsidiary

Charges were unsealed today against two former executives of Rolls-Royce plc and its subsidiaries (Rolls-Royce), a former Rolls-Royce
employee, a former intermediary for Rolls-Royce in Kazakhstan and an executive of an international engineering consulting firm - all for their
alleged participation in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials for the benefit of a U.S.-based Rolls-Royce subsidiary, including
to secure a contract to supply equipment and services to power a gas pipeline from Central Asia to China.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman of the
Southern District of Ohio, Inspector in Charge Regina Faulkerson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Serviceâs Criminal Investigations Group, Assistant
Director Stephen E. Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division and Assistant Director in Charge Andrew W. Vale of the FBIâs
Washington Field Office made the announcement.

Petros Contoguris, 70, a citizen of Greece residing in Turkey, was charged by an indictment filed in the Southern District of Ohio on Oct. 12, and
unsealed today, with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of conspiracy to launder money,
seven counts of violating the FCPA and 10 counts of money laundering. Contoguris is believed to be outside of the United States. James Finley,
66, a citizen of the United Kingdom residing in Taiwan, pleaded guilty on July 28, before Chief Judge Edmund A. Sargus Jr. of the Southern
District of Ohio, to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. Aloysius Johannes Jozef Zuurhout, 53, of the
Netherlands; Andreas Kohler, 53, of Austria; and Keith Barnett, 48, of Houston, Texas, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate
the FCPA before Chief Judge Sargus on June 13; June 6; and Dec. 20, 2016, respectively.

âThe charges announced today against executives, employees, and third parties affiliated with Rolls-Royce, is another example of the Criminal
Divisionâs commitment to holding individuals - and not just corporations - accountable for violating the FCPA,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Blanco. âThanks to the coordinated efforts by our prosecutors and agents - working closely with their counterparts in Brazil and at the
United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, among others - these defendants, many of whom reside overseas, will face justice in this case, which
represents another important step towards leveling the playing field for all ethical and honest businesses.â

âThe charges unsealed today reflect the determination and ability of the United States to investigate and prosecute individuals who engage in
foreign corrupt business practices, regardless of how sophisticated or far-flung the scheme may be,â said U.S. Attorney Glassman. âWe can and
will follow the evidence wherever it leads - from Columbus to Kazakhstan and beyond.â

âThis type of sophisticated fraud scheme can cause immeasurable economic losses to competitive markets around the world,â said Inspector in
Charge Faulkerson. âAnyone who engages in deceptive practices should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable. The
U.S. Postal Inspection Service has an extensive history of successfully investigating complex fraud and corruption cases. The collaborative
investigative work conducted by Postal Inspectors and our domestic and international law enforcement partners illustrates our efforts to protect
the United States and the international marketplace.â

âTodayâs indictment and guilty pleas reveal that those associated with this corruption did knowingly conspire to break the law for their own
personal gain,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âNo one is above the law, so let todayâs announcement be a warning to those who may try to
perpetrate a similar scheme that the FBI will aggressively pursue those who attempt to bribe foreign officials for an unfair advantage in the
global marketplace.â

âTodayâs charges demonstrate the immense capabilities of the FBIâs Washington Field Office international corruption program and the global
impact of the anti-corruption program,â said Assistant Director in Charge Vale. âThe FBI is committed to holding accountable those who disrupt
the level playing field to which companies in the United States and around the world are entitled.â

According to the indictment and informations unsealed today, Contoguris, the founder and chief executive officer of Gravitas & CIE.
International Ltd. (Gravitas); Finley, a former senior executive in energy at Rolls-Royce; Barnett, a former regional director in energy at Rolls-
Royce; Zuurhout, a former energy sales employee at Rolls-Royce; and Kohler, a managing director at an international engineering and
consulting firm, and others, allegedly conspired to pay bribes to foreign officials in exchange for directing business to Rolls-Royce Energy
Systems Inc. (RRESI). RRESI was a U.S.-based indirect subsidiary of Rolls-Royce plc, the United Kingdom-based manufacturer and distributor of
power systems for the aerospace, defense, marine and energy sectors.

The indictment alleges that Contoguris, working with employees of an international engineering consulting firm (Technical Advisor), including
Kohler, devised a scheme with Rolls-Royce executives and employees, including Zuurhout, Barnett and Finley, whereby Rolls-Royce would pay
kickbacks to the Technical Advisor employees, and bribes to at least one foreign official, and disguise these payments as commissions to
Contogurisâs company, Gravitas, in exchange for helping Rolls-Royce win contracts with Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP).

According to the indictment, AGP was created to build and connect a gas pipeline between Central Asia and China, and the Technical Advisor
purported to provide independent engineering consulting advice and other services to AGP. The indictment further alleges that after AGP
awarded Rolls-Royce a contract in November 2009, worth approximately $145 million, Rolls-Royce made commission payments to Gravitas, and
Contoguris then passed a portion of those commission payments onto the Technical Advisor employees knowing that they would share that
money with a foreign official consistent with their corrupt agreement.

In pleading guilty, Finley, Barnett and Zuurhout admitted that they each participated in a conspiracy, going as far back as approximately 1999
and continuing into 2013, to engage commercial advisors who would use their commission payments from Rolls-Royce to bribe foreign officials
in a number of countries to help Rolls-Royce secure an improper advantage and obtain and retain business with foreign governments and
instrumentalities across the globe.

The charges announced today follow the announcement on Jan. 17, of a deferred prosecution agreement with Rolls-Royce plc and a more than
$800 million total penalty as part of a global resolution to investigations by the Department of Justice and U.K. and Brazilian authorities related
to the corrupt conduct. The agreement acknowledged Rolls-Royceâs cooperation in this case, including with the Departmentâs investigation into
individuals, and significant remedial measures.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a
court of law.

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. In 2015, the FBI
formed International Corruption Squads across the country to address national and international implications of foreign corruption. Trial
Attorneys Kevin R. Gingras and Vanessa Snyder and Assistant Chief Ephraim Wernick of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Michael J. Marous and Jessica Kim of the Southern District of Ohio are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office
provided significant cooperation and assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement colleagues in Brazil, which both coordinated with the
Department to reach simultaneous resolutions with Rolls-Royce. The Department also thanks its law enforcement colleagues in Austria,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and Turkey.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Former Venezuelan Official Pleads Guilty in Connection with International Bribery and Money
Laundering Scheme

A dual U.S.-Venezuelan citizen and former official at Citgo Petroleum Corporation, a Houston-based subsidiary of Venezuelaâs state-owned and
state-controlled energy company PetrdÃ©leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), pleaded guilty Monday in connection with his role in laundering millions
of dollars in bribes and corruptly providing business advantages to multiple individuals who obtained contracts with Citgo and PDVSA.

According to court documents, between approximately 2013 and 2019, Jose Luis De Jongh Atencio (De Jongh), 48, a former procurement officer
and manager in Citgoâs Special Projects Group, accepted more than $7 million in bribe payments from businessmen including Jose Manuel
Gonzalez Testino (Gonzalez), a dual U.S.-Venezuelan citizen, and Tulio Anibal Farias Perez (Farias), a Venezuelan national and Houston resident,
and others in exchange for assisting the businessmen and related companies in procuring contracts with Citgo, and providing them with other
business advantages.

De Jongh admitted to directing bribe payments from Gonzalez, Farias, and others into bank accounts in the names of shell companies that he
controlled in Panama and Switzerland. In some instances, he also directed the creation of fake invoices to justify the payments. De Jongh

laundered the bribe proceeds through U.S. and international bank accounts and used the funds to purchase real property located in the Houston
area. In addition to monetary payments, De Jongh also received bribes in the form of gifts and other things of value from Gonzalez, Farias, and
others including tickets to a 2014 World Series Game, Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, and a U2 concert. Gonzalez and Farias also entered guilty pleas
in connection with the case.

âJose Luis De Jongh Atencio accepted millions of dollars in bribe payments â placing law-abiding individuals and companies at a competitive
disadvantage â and then laundered those bribe payments into the United States to fund his lavish lifestyle,â said Acting Assistant Attorney
General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThis guilty plea demonstrates the commitment of the department

and our law enforcement partners to hold accountable individuals who engage in corruption and use our financial system to promote and
launder the proceeds of their crimes.â

âForeign bribery schemes like this pose a significant threat to the public trust and fair-trade practices,â
said Special Agent in Charge Mark
Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston. âThis plea is a step in the right
direction, but we will continue to level the playing field for companies and consumers by aggressively investigating individuals and corporations
who violate the FCPA and misuse our financial system.â

â

De Jongh pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gray H.
Miller on Aug. 19, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Judge Miller will determine any sentence after considering the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. In addition, as part of his plea, De Jongh also agreed to forfeit over $3 million seized from his
bank accounts and 15 properties that he purchased with his corrupt proceeds.

To date, the Justice Department has announced charges against 28 individuals, 22 of whom have pleaded guilty, as part of a larger, ongoing
investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA.

HSI Houston is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from HSI Boston and Miami.

Trial Attorney Sarah E. Edwards and Assistant Chief Sonali D. Patel of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Robert
S. Johnson and John P. Pearson of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney
Kristine E. Rollinson is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

Former Venezuelan Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Charge in Connection with Bribery
Scheme

A dual U.S.-Venezuelan citizen pleaded guilty today for his role in a scheme to bribe officials of Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled
energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), and for his role in an international money laundering scheme involving the bribes paid
by the owners of U.S.-based companies to Venezuelan government officials to corruptly secure energy contracts and payment priority on
outstanding invoices.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern
District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs (ICE) Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (HSI) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

Luis Carlos De Leon-Perez (De Leon), 42, a citizen of the United States and Venezuela previously residing in Spain, pleaded guilty today in
federal court in Houston to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one count of conspiracy to commit
money laundering. U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt of the Southern District of Texas accepted De Leonâs plea. Sentencing is scheduled for
Sept. 24.

De Leon was arrested in Spain in October 2017 and subsequently extradited to the United States after a federal grand jury in the Southern
District of Texas returned a 20-count indictment against him and Nervis Gerardo Villalobos Cardenas (Villalobos), 51; Cesar David Rincon Godoy
(Cesar Rincon), 51; Alejandro Isturiz Chiesa (Isturiz), 33; and Rafael Ernesto Reiter Munoz (Reiter), 39.

According to admissions made in connection with De Leonâs plea, between 2011 and 2013, he conspired with Villalobos, Cesar Rincon, Isturiz
and others, all of whom were then officials of PDVSA and its subsidiaries or former officials of other Venezuelan government agencies or
instrumentalities, to solicit PDVSA vendors for bribes and kickbacks in exchange for providing assistance to those vendors in connection with
their PDVSA business. Specifically, De Leon admitted that he solicited and directed bribes from Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Roberto
Rincon), 57, of The Woodlands, Texas, and Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 55, of Coral Gables, Florida, to PDVSA officials in order to
assist Roberto Rinconâs and Shieraâs companies, including their U.S.-based companies, in receiving payment priority and receiving additional
PDVSA contracts. De Leon further admitted that he then conspired with Roberto Rincon and Shiera to launder and conceal the proceeds of the
bribery scheme through a series of financial transactions, including wire transfers to accounts in Switzerland held in the names of individuals or
entities other than De Leon and his co-conspirators.

As part of his plea agreement, De Leon also admitted to soliciting bribes from other owners of energy companies based in the United States and
elsewhere, and directing a portion of such bribes to PDVSA officials in order to assist those individuals and their companies in winning business
with PDVSA and to obtain payment from PDVSA on outstanding invoices ahead of other PDVSA vendors.

Roberto Rincon and Shiera previously pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Texas to charges under the FCPA for their respective roles in the
bribery scheme. Cesar Rincon previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. They currently await
sentencing.

The charges against Villalobos, Isturiz and Reiter remain pending. Each of the three remaining defendants is charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering and with one or more counts of money laundering. Villalobos is also charged with one count of
conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Villalobos and Reiter remain in Spain pending extradition and Isturiz remains at large.

The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt in a court of law.

De Leon is the latest individual to plead guilty as part of a larger, ongoing investigation by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA. Including
De Leon, Cesar Rincon, Roberto Rincon and Shiera, the Justice Department has announced the guilty pleas of a total of 12 individuals in
connection with the investigation.

HSI in Houston is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from HSI in Boston and Madrid, as well as from Internal Revenue Service
Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Jeremy R. Sanders and Sarah E. Edwards of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S.
Attorneys John P. Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristine
Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs, the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and the Spanish Guardia Civil have provided substantial
assistance.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, June 4, 2018

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale S.A. Agrees to Pay $860 Million in Criminal Penalties for Bribing Gaddafi-Era
Libyan Officials and Manipulating LIBOR Rate

Bank admits to making over $90 million in corrupt payments; Acknowledges manipulation of global
benchmark interest rate, impacting financial products traded worldwide

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale S.A. (SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale), a global financial services institution based in Paris, France, and its wholly owned subsidiary, SGA
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Acceptance N.V., have agreed to pay a combined total penalty of more than $860 million to resolve charges with criminal
authorities in the United States and France, including $585 million relating to a multi-year scheme to pay bribes to officials in Libya and $275
million for violations arising from its manipulation of the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), one of the worldâs leading benchmark interest
rates. SGA SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Acceptance N.V. will plead guilty in the Eastern District of New York in connection with the resolution of the foreign
bribery case. Together with approximately $475 million in regulatory penalties and disgorgement that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale has agreed to pay to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in connection with the LIBOR scheme, the total penalties to be paid by the bank exceed $1
billion.

In related proceedings, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale reached a settlement with the Parquet National Financier (PNF) in Paris relating to the Libya corruption
scheme. The United States will credit $292,776,444 that SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale will pay to the PNF under its agreement, equal to 50 percent of the
total criminal penalty otherwise payable to the United States. This is the first coordinated resolution with French authorities in a foreign bribery
case.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the
Eastern District of New York, Special Agent in Charge Matthew J. DeSarno of the FBI Washington Field Office's Criminal Division, Assistant
Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI New York Field Office and Deputy Chief Eric Hylton of IRS Criminal Investigation made the
announcement.

âFor years, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale undermined the integrity of global markets and foreign institutions by issuing false financial data and by
fraudulently securing contracts through bribery,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Cronan. âTodayâs resolution - which marks the first
coordinated resolution with France in a foreign bribery case - sends a strong message that transnational corruption and manipulation of our
markets will be met with a global and coordinated law enforcement response.â

âThe resolution announced today by the Department with Societe Generale and a subsidiary, which includes a guilty plea, admissions of
wrongdoing, significant corrective measures and hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties, sends a powerful message to financial institutions
that engage in corruption and manipulation in the financial markets that they will be held accountable,â said U.S. Attorney Donoghue. âThe
United States will vigorously protect the integrity of financial markets by holding responsible to the full extent of the law those banks,
corporations and individuals who seek to corrupt government officials to enrich themselves.â

âToday's resolution demonstrates that fraudulently manipulating LIBOR and deceiving the financial market has severe consequences, and the
FBI will not tolerate this type of criminal activity,â said FBI Special Agent in Charge DeSarno. âThe FBI remains committed to holding institutions
accountable for their actions in breaking the law and manipulating the global benchmark interest rate. The personnel of the FBI Washington
Field Office have dedicated significant time and resources to investigating complex financial fraud schemes such as this one, and | want to
thank them for their tireless efforts as well as our colleagues at the Department of Justice Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S.
Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York for their hard work.â

âWhen financial institutions convince foreign officials to accept bribes in return for lucrative business deals, their actions directly threaten the
international free market system, not to mention our national security,"" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. ""But being
geographically out of sight doesnât mean you're out of reach from prosecution. No matter who you are, where you are, or how much money you
have, the FBI will continue to use all resources at our disposal to find you, uncover your crimes, and reveal them for what they really are. Many
thanks to the hardworking men and women of the FBIâs New York Field Office for leading the effort to expose this scheme and bring its
perpetrators to justice.â

âTodayâs announcement resulted from the unraveling of international financial transactions orchestrated by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale and its agents to
facilitate illegal payments to foreign government officials in Libya,â said IRS-Cl Deputy Chief Hylton. âIRS-Cl is a trusted partner in pursuit of
those who use pervasive bribery schemes to circumvent the law. We are committed to maintaining fair competition, free of corrupt practices,
through global teamwork and our robust financial investigative talents.â

The FCPA Case

According to the companiesâ admissions, between 2004 and 2009, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale paid bribes through a Libyan âbrokerâ in connection with 14
investments made by Libyan state-owned financial institutions. For each transaction, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale paid the Libyan broker a commission of
between one and a half and three percent of the nominal amount of the investments made by the Libyan state institutions. In total, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale paid the Libyan Intermediary over $90 million, portions of which the Libyan broker paid to high-level Libyan officials in order to secure
the investments from various Libyan state institutions for SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. As a result of the corrupt scheme, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale obtained 13
investments and one restructuring from the Libyan state institutions worth a total of approximately $3.66 billion, and earned profits of
approximately $523 million.

SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale will enter into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with a criminal information charging the company with one
count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of transmitting false commodities reports. Additionally,
SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs subsidiary, SGA SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Acceptance N.V., will plead guilty to a one-count criminal information filed today in the
Eastern District of New York charging the company with a conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to its
agreement with the Department, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $585 million to the Department. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
also agreed to continue to cooperate with the Departmentâs investigation and adopt and maintain enhanced compliance procedures. The guilty
plea is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, June 5, before U.S. District Judge Dora L. Irizarry of the Eastern District of New York.

The Department entered into this resolution in part due to SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs failure to voluntarily self-disclose the companiesâ misconduct to
the Department; the seriousness of the companiesâ conduct, including the high value of the bribes paid to foreign officials; the companyâs
substantial, though not full, cooperation with the Department; and the companyâs significant remediation which, together with the companyâs
risk profile and ongoing monitoring by LâAgence Francaise Anticorruption, resulted in the Department determining that a monitor was not
necessary in this case.

The LIBOR Case

As admitted by the company, between May 2010 and at least October 2011, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale promulgated falsely deflated U.S. Dollar (USD)
LIBOR submissions to make it look as though SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale was able to borrow money at more favorable interest rates than it was actually
able to do. This downward manipulation allowed SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale to create the appearance that it was stronger and more creditworthy than it
was.

The USD LIBOR manipulation scheme was ordered by senior executives of SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, who tasked the managers of the companyâs
Treasury Department with overseeing the execution of the deflation effort. Several employees within SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs Treasury Department
ensured that the companyâs USD LIBOR submissions were altered in accordance with the deflation directive. SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs misconduct
frequently altered the daily rate at which USD LIBOR was set, which affected financial products worldwide, including interest rate swaps, futures
contracts and other derivative financial products.

Further, in 2006, certain SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale employees in London and Tokyo worked together to manipulate SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©raleâs Japan Yen (JPY)
LIBOR submissions. These employees endeavored to manipulate JPY LIBOR in order to benefit the trading positions of a SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale
employee. This employee had numerous deals tied to JPY LIBOR, and manipulation of JPY LIBOR improved the profitability of the employeeâs
trading book.

By the terms of the agreement, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale will pay a fine of $275 million to resolve the LIBOR misconduct matter. Additionally, in August
2017, two individualsâformer SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Global Treasury Head Danielle Sindzingre and former Paris Treasury Head Muriel Bescondâ
were indicted for their roles in the scheme. Both individuals remain at large. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are
presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The deferred prosecution agreement and the plea agreement are subject to court approval.

The FBIâs Washington and New York Field Offices and IRS-Criminal Investigationâs New York office are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys
Gerald M. Moody Jr. and Dennis R. Kihm of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David C. Pitluck and James P.
McDonald of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the FCPA case. Assistant Chief Carol Sipperly, Trial Attorneys Timothy A. Duree
and Gary A. Winters of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew S. Amatruda of the Eastern District of New
York are prosecuting the LIBOR case. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter.

The Department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the CFTC
in this matter. The PNF, the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office, the Federal Office of Justice in Switzerland and the Office of the Attorney
General in Switzerland also provided significant cooperation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, January 12, 2017

Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. Agrees to Pay $17.4 Million to Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Charges

Subsidiary Agrees to Plead Guilty to Violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. (Zimmer Biomet), an Indiana-based manufacturer of orthopedic and dental implant devices, has agreed to pay a
$17.4 million criminal penalty in connection with a scheme to pay bribes to government officials in Mexico and for violations of the internal
controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) involving the companyâs operations in Mexico and Brazil. Zimmer Biomet had
been in breach of a 2012 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the department resolving an earlier investigation into FCPA violations
committed by Biomet Inc., which became part of Zimmer Biomet in 2015.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division and Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the
FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division made the announcement.

âZimmer Biomet had the opportunity to avoid criminal charges but its misconduct allowed the bribes to continue,â said Assistant Attorney
General Caldwell. âZimmer Biomet is now paying the price for disregarding its obligations under the earlier deferred prosecution agreement. In
appropriate circumstances the department will resolve serious criminal conduct through alternative means, but there will be consequences for
those companies that refuse to take these agreements seriously.â

âZimmer Biomet failed to rectify their misconduct and get back on track in compliance with the law, and now they are facing the consequences
of their corrupt actions,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âThe FBI will not stand idly by when companies operate outside the law and
attempt to play by different rules in the marketplace. We remain vigilant and committed to holding those accountable who disregard the rule of
law in the United States.â

According to admissions made in the resolution documents, even after the 2012 DPA between the department and Biomet, the company
knowingly and willfully continued to use a third-party distributor in Brazil known to have paid bribes to government officials on Biometâs behalf.
Biomet also failed to implement an adequate system of internal accounting controls at the companyâs subsidiary in Mexico, despite employees
and executives having been made aware of red flags suggesting that bribes were being paid. By failing to require appropriate due diligence and
documentation and contracts for payments to third parties, Biomet allowed its Mexican subsidiary, Biomet 3i Mexico S.A. de C.V. (3i Mexico), to
pay bribes to Mexican customs officials through customs brokers and sub-agents so 3i Mexico could import contraband dental implants into
Mexico. Importing those products into Mexico violated Mexican law because they lacked proper registration or labeling.

Zimmer Biomet entered into a three-year DPA tin connection with a superseding criminal information, filed today in the District of Columbia,
charging the company with failing to implement a system of effective internal accounting controls. Pursuant to its agreement with the
department, Zimmer Biomet agreed to pay a $17.4 million criminal penalty and retain an independent corporate compliance monitor for three
years.

JERDS Luxembourg Holding S.ar.|. JERDS), an indirect subsidiary of Zimmer Biomet, agreed to plead guilty to a one-count criminal information,
also filed in the District of Columbia, charging it with causing Biomet to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA through the actions
of 3i Mexico, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JERDS. The plea agreement is subject to court approval. The case was assigned to Senior U.S. District
Judge Reggie B. Walton of the District of Columbia and the change of plea is scheduled to take place on Jan. 13, 2017 at 3:45 p.m.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Zimmer Biomet whereby the
company agreed to pay to the SEC disgorgement of $6.5 million including pre-judgment interest and $6.5 million as a civil penalty.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that Zimmer Biomet was in breach of the
2012 DPA between Biomet and the department. That agreement resolved an earlier investigation by the department into violations of the FCPA
committed by Biomet, including the bribery of government officials in Argentina, Brazil and China as well as the falsification of the companyâs
financial records to conceal the true nature of the bribe payments. Pursuant to the 2012 DPA, Biomet had been required to retain an
independent compliance monitor. The monitorâs term was extended for one year in 2015, due to both the bribery in Brazil and Mexico and the
fact that the Zimmer Biomet compliance program did not meet the requirements of the 2012 DPA. At the conclusion of the extended period, the
independent monitor was unable to certify that the companyâs compliance program satisfied the requirements of the 2012 DPA and the
department notified Zimmer Biomet that it was deemed to be in breach of the agreement. Zimmer Biomet fully cooperated with the current
investigation and provided to the Fraud Section all relevant facts known to the company, including information about individuals involved in the
misconduct. Nevertheless, because Zimmer Biomet failed to implement an effective compliance program and committed additional crimes
while under a DPA and monitorship, the current DPA requires Zimmer Biomet retain an independent compliance monitor for a term of three
years.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. Assistant Chief Tarek J. Helou and Trial Attorney John
Borchert of the Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Office of International Affairs also provided substantial assistance in this matter.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Monday, July 6, 2020

Two Defendants Charged for Their Role in Bribery and Money Laundering Scheme Involving
Former High-Ranking Government Official in Panama

Individuals Facilitated $28 Million in Bribes from Odebrecht S.A. to the Official

A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, charging Luis Enrique Martinelli Linares (Luis Martinelli Linares)
and Ricardo Alberto Martinelli Linares (Ricardo Martinelli Linares) for their roles in a massive bribery and money laundering scheme involving
Odebrecht S.A. (Odebrecht), a Brazil-based global construction conglomerate.

On Dec. 21, 2016, Odebrecht pleaded guilty in the Eastern District of New York to a criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate
the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its involvement in the bribery and money laundering scheme.

The overarching Odebrecht scheme involved the payment of more than $700 million in bribes to government officials, public servants, political
parties, and others in Panama and other countries around the world to obtain and retain business for the company. The two individual
defendants are alleged to have participated in the scheme by, among other things, serving as intermediaries for approximately $28 million in
bribe payments made by and at the direction of Odebrecht to a then high-ranking government official in Panama (Panama Government Official),
who was a close relative of the defendants. Luis Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Martinelli Linares were each charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering.

Luis Martinelli Linares and Ricardo Martinelli Linares were arrested at el Aeropuerto Internacional la Aurora in Guatemala on July 6 pursuant to a
provisional arrest request from the United States.

As alleged in the complaint, between approximately August 2009 and January 2014, the defendants facilitated the payment of bribes from
Odebrecht to or for the benefit of the Panama Government Official by taking a number of steps that included opening and managing secret
bank accounts held in the names of shell companies in foreign jurisdictions. These secret bank accounts were used to receive, transfer, and
deliver the bribe payments. The defendants served as the signatories on certain of the shell company bank accounts, and personally sent and
caused to be sent wire transfers through the structure of shell company bank accounts to conceal and spend bribery proceeds. Many of these
financial transactions were in U.S. dollars and were made through U.S. banks, some of which were located in New York.

The charges in the complaint announced today are allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The FBI's International Corruption squad in New York investigated this case. Trial Attorney Michael Culhane Harper of the Criminal Divisionâs
Fraud Section, Trial Attorneys Barbara Levy and Michael Redmann of the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, and
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alixandra Smith and Julia Nestor of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the
case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided substantial assistance. The Brazilian Ministerio Publico Federal, Departamento de
Policia Federal, law enforcement authorities in Guatemala including the Public Ministry of Guatemala and Specialized Unit for International
Affairs, and law enforcement authorities in El Salvador provided significant cooperation.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, November 1, 2018

Malaysian Financier Low Taek Jho, Also Known As âJho Low,â and Former Banker Ng Chong Hwa,
Also Known As âRoger Ng,â Indicted for Conspiring to Launder Billions of Dollars in Illegal
Proceeds and to Pay Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Bribes

Former Banker Tim Leissner Pleaded Guilty to Conspiring to Launder Money and to Violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act Related to IMDB

A three-count criminal indictment was unsealed today in federal court in the Eastern District of New York charging Low Taek Jho, 36, also known
as âJho Low,â and Ng Chong Hwa, 51, also known as âRoger Ng,â with conspiring to launder billions of dollars embezzled from 1Malaysia
Development Berhad (1MDB), Malaysiaâs investment development fund, and conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by
paying bribes to various Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials. As part of the three-count indictment, Ng is also charged with conspiring to violate
the FCPA by circumventing the internal accounting controls of a major New York-headquartered financial institution (Financial Institution), which
underwrote more than $6 billion in bonds issued by 1MDB in three separate bond offerings in 2012 and 2013, while Ng was employed at the
Financial Institution as a managing director. Ng was arrested earlier today in Malaysia, pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant issued at the
request of the United States. Low remains at large.

Also unsealed today in federal court in the Eastern District of New York was the guilty plea of Tim Leissner, 48, the former Southeast Asia
Chairman and participating managing director of the Financial Institution, to a two-count criminal information charging Leissner with conspiring
to launder money and conspiring to violate the FCPA by both paying bribes to various Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials and circumventing the
internal accounting controls of the Financial Institution while he was employed by it. According to court filings, Leissner has been ordered to
forfeit $43.7 million as a result of his crimes.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue for
the Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI New York Field Office, and Special Agent in
Charge R. Damon Rowe of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) Los Angeles Field Office announced the charges.

The Criminal Scheme

1MDB is a Malaysian state-owned and controlled fund created to pursue investment and development projects for the economic benefit of
Malaysia and its people. As alleged in court filings, between approximately 2009 and 2014, as IMDB raised money to fund its projects, billions
of dollars were misappropriated and fraudulently diverted from 1MDB, including funds 1MDB raised in 2012 and 2013 through three bond
transactions that it executed with the Financial Institution. As part of the scheme, and as alleged in court filings, Low, Ng, Leissner, and others
conspired to bribe government officials in Malaysia, including at IMDB, and Abu Dhabi to obtain and retain lucrative business for the Financial
Institution, including the 2012 and 2013 bond deals. They also allegedly conspired to launder the proceeds of their criminal conduct through
the U.S. financial system by purchasing, among other things, luxury residential real estate in New York City and elsewhere, and artwork from a
New York-based auction house, and by funding major Hollywood films.

As alleged, Lowâs close relationships with high-ranking government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi were central to the scheme. Ng,
Leissner, and others at the Financial Institution allegedly knew Low was close to these government officials, including a high-ranking Malaysian
government official who had authority to approve 1MDB business decisions (Malaysian Official #1). According to allegations in court filings,
beginning in approximately 2009 and continuing through 2014, Low, Ng, Leissner, and the other co-conspirators used Lowâs relationships to
obtain and retain business for the Financial Institution through the promise and payment of hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes, including to
ensure 1MDB awarded the Financial Institution a role on three bond transactions known internally at the Financial Institution as âProject
Magnolia,â âProject Maximus,â and âProject Catalyze.â As a result of its work for LMDB during that time, the Financial Institution allegedly
received approximately $600 million in fees and revenues along with increased reputational prestige. At the same time, Ng, Leissner and
others allegedly received large bonuses and enhanced their own reputations at the Financial Institution. In total, according to allegations in
court filings, more than $2.7 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and Low, Ng, Leissner and others conspired to launder this money through
the U.S. financial system to pay bribes to foreign officials and for the personal benefit of themselves and their relatives.

Project Magnolia

In early 2012, according to allegations in court filings, following a series of meetings in Malaysia and the United Kingdom, Low, Leissner, Ng and
the co-conspirators agreed that, with the assistance of the Financial Institution, IMDB would issue $1.75 billion in bonds guaranteed by an
entity wholly-owned and controlled by the government of Abu Dhabi. Low allegedly explained to Ng, Leissner, and others at the time that, to
complete the transaction, bribes would need to be paid to officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi and hundreds of millions of dollars were allegedly
paid to officials in these countries. Court filings also allege that Low, Ng, Leissner, and other co-conspirators knew that Low intended to use
funds misappropriated from the bond transaction to bribe and influence the officials to obtain the necessary approvals and any additional
assistance to execute Project Magnolia for the Financial Institution and to pay kickbacks to Ng, Leissner, and others.

In or around March 2012, 1MDB allegedly selected the Financial Institution to be the sole bookrunner and arranger for Project Magnolia. As part
of the scheme, Low and other co-conspirators allegedly enlisted the assistance of 1MDB officials, promising to pay them bribes and kickbacks.
In one instance, as alleged in court filings, in connection with Project Magnolia, Low told one 1MDB official that he would â[glive [the official a]
big presentâ when the transaction closed. According to allegations in court documents, the fact that bribes and kickbacks were being paid in
connection with Project Magnolia was known to Ng, Leissner, and other employees of the Financial Institution.

After Project Magnolia closed on or about May 21, 2012, more than $500 million of the bond proceeds were allegedly misappropriated and
diverted from 1MDB through numerous wire transfers to bank accounts in the name of shell companies beneficially owned and controlled by
Low, Leissner, Ng, and other co-conspirators, including a high-level official at the Abu Dhabi entity that guaranteed the Project Magnolia bonds
and a close relative of Malaysian Official #1. As alleged, the bond proceeds transferred to Malaysian Official #1âs close relative were later used
by the relativeâs U.S. motion picture company to assist in the production of the film âThe Wolf of Wall Street.â

Project Maximus and Project Catalyze

Court filings further allege that from May 2012 and continuing through 2013, Low, Ng, Leissner, and their co-conspirators continued to work to
ensure that the Financial Institution obtained and retained additional 1MDB business, including the bond transactions known as âProject
Maximusâ and âProject Catalyze,â which transactions generated substantial fees and revenues for the Financial Institution. As alleged, although
both transactions were designed to raise more than $4 billion for L[MDBâs investment and development projects, Low, Ng, Leissner, and other
co-conspirators used the transactions to further the criminal scheme, ultimately laundering hundreds of millions of dollars of diverted funds
from these transactions into bank accounts beneficially owned and controlled by, among others, the co-conspirators, including Low, Leissner
and officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. As alleged in court filings, throughout this time, Ng, Leissner, and at least one other employee of the
Financial Institution knew that Low would and did pay bribes to influence officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to obtain the necessary approvals
to execute Project Maximus and Project Catalyze. Low, Ng, Leissner, and others also allegedly knew that large portions of the bond proceeds
would be illegally diverted to themselves and others, including to foreign government officials.

As part of the scheme alleged in court filings, Low, Ng, Leissner and other co-conspirators again used a series of wire transfers to launder
billions of dollars of misappropriated and fraudulently diverted funds from Project Maximus and Project Catalyze. Following the close of Project
Maximus, approximately $790 million of the bond proceeds was allegedly transferred through a series of shell company accounts beneficially
owned and controlled by Low, Leissner and others, including accounts of officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. In particular, Leissner and Ng
allegedly caused millions of dollars of these funds to be transferred to accounts of 1MDB officials or relatives of such officials in exchange for
their assistance in obtaining and retaining business for the Financial Institution. Over $35 million of the bond proceeds also allegedly was used
by a co-conspirator to help acquire a condominium in New York, New York beneficially owned by Low.

Similarly, according to allegations in court filings, after Project Catalyze closed in March 2013, more than $1 billion of diverted funds, traceable
to the transaction, were laundered, at Lowâs direction, to bank accounts in the name of entities beneficially owned and controlled by Low,
Leissner, and others, including LMDB officials. As alleged, more than $4 million of the funds were transferred to a bank account beneficially
owned by a relative of Ng. Additionally, as part of the scheme, Low allegedly used a shell company account to receive more than $1 billion of
the Project Catalyze bond proceeds and spent approximately $137 million of these funds to purchase works of art at a high-end art auction
house in New York, New York.

Post-Catalyze IMDB Transactions at the Financial Institution

The Financial Institution continued to seek business from 1MDB after Project Catalyze. As alleged, Leissner and others were particularly focused
on securing a role for the Financial Institution on a proposed initial public offering (IPO) of LMDBâs energy assets. To influence certain officials to
award the Financial Institution a role in the proposed IPO, Low and Leissner allegedly continued to pay bribes to certain officials at IMDB.

For example, as alleged, in an online chat between Low and Leissner in June 2014, Low and Leissner discussed the need to âsuck up toâ a IMDB
official and to send âcakesâ to a person believed to be the wife of Malaysian Official #1. A few months after this chat, a bank account owned
and controlled by Leissner and his relative was used to transfer approximately $4.1 million to a high-end New York jeweler, in part, to pay for
gold jewelry for the wife of Malaysian Official #1.

The charges in the indictment as to Low and Ng are merely allegations, and those defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The investigation was jointly conducted by the FBI's International Corruption Unit and IRS-Cl. The governmentâs criminal case is being handled
by the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Fraud Section and the Business and Securities Fraud
Section of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the Eastern District of New York. MLARS Trial Attorneys Jennifer E. Ambuehl, Woo S. Lee, and Mary Ann

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, December 29, 2016

General Cable Corporation Agrees to Pay $20 Million Penalty for Foreign Bribery Schemes in Asia
and Africa

General Cable Corporation, a Kentucky-based manufacturer and distributor of cable and wire, entered into a non-prosecution agreement and
agreed to pay a $20 million penalty, reflecting a 50 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range, to resolve the
governmentâs investigation into improper payments to government officials in Angola, Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and Thailand to corruptly
gain business in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), announced Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Criminal
Division and Assistant Director Stephen Richardson of the FBIâs Criminal Investigative Division.

âGeneral Cable paid bribes to officials in multiple countries in a scheme that involved a high-level executive of the company and resulted in
profits of more than $50 million worldwide,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âBut General Cable also voluntarily self-disclosed this
misconduct to the government, fully cooperated and remediated. This resolution demonstrates the very real upside to coming in and
cooperating with federal prosecutors and investigators. It also reflects our ongoing commitment to transparency.â

âIn 2015, International Corruption Squads across the country were formed to address the national and international implications of foreign
corruption,â said Assistant Director Richardson. âThis settlement is an example of the exceptional efforts of those dedicated squads and
investigators. The FBI looks forward to continuing to work with our law enforcement partners to address corruption, no matter how big or
small.â

According to General Cableâs admissions, some parent-level and subsidiary-level employees, including executives, knew that some of its foreign
subsidiaries used third-party agents and distributors to make corrupt payments to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business. In one
case the foreign subsidiary made corrupt payments directly to foreign officials. The corrupt conduct began in 2002. In 2011, when employees
from a General Cable subsidiary expressed concerns to regional and parent-level executives that commission payments were being used for
improper purposes, including potentially bribery, General Cable nevertheless failed to implement and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls designed to detect and prevent such corruption and otherwise illegal payments.

According to admissions by General Cable made in connection with the resolution, these payments were discussed openly in email messages.
For example, in June 2012, a sales agent in Bangladesh emailed an executive and other employees of General Cableâs subsidiary in Thailand
and said that a portion of the money that the Thailand subsidiary paid the sales agent would âbe shared by decision makers in [the] customer,
concerned higher ups in [the] Ministry[,] and some top executives at [the] bidder.â In May 2013, the executive, who had become an executive
at General Cable in December 2012, approved a payment to the Bangladeshi sales agent. In addition, in 2011, the same executive, who was at
that time working at General Cableâs Thailand subsidiary, informed a General Cable executive that payments to a distributor in Thailand were
being used for corrupt purposes. General Cable did not investigate those payments, which continued to be made.

Between 2002 and 2013, General Cable subsidiaries paid approximately $13 million to third-party agents and distributors, a portion of which
was used to make unlawful payments to obtain business, ultimately netting the company approximately $51 million in profits.

General Cable entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $20,469,694.80 to resolve the matter. As part
of the agreement, General Cable has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions
relating to the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program and to report to the department on the implementation of
its enhanced compliance program.

The department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that General Cable voluntarily and timely disclosed the conduct
at issue, fully cooperated in the investigation and fully remediated. General Cableâs cooperation included conducting a thorough internal
investigation; making regular factual presentations and proactively providing updates to the Fraud Section; voluntarily making foreign-based
employees available for interviews in the United States; producing documents, including translations, to the Fraud Section from foreign
countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws; collecting, analyzing and organizing voluminous evidence and information for
the Fraud Section; identifying, investigating and disclosing conduct to the Fraud Section that was outside the scope of its initial voluntary self-
disclosure; and, by the conclusion of the investigation, providing to the Fraud Section all relevant facts known to it, including information about
individuals and third parties involved in the misconduct. General Cable also took extensive remedial measures, including taking employment
action against 13 employees who participated in the misconduct, resulting in their departure from the company, and terminating its
relationships with 47 third-party agents and distributors who participated in the misconduct. Based on these actions and other considerations,
the company received a non-prosecution agreement and an aggregate discount of 50 percent off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines fine range.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against General Cable, whereby
General Cable agreed to pay approximately $55 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined
penalties and disgorgement paid by General Cable is approximately $75.75 million. The Fraud Section appreciates the cooperation and
assistance provided by the SEC in this matter.

The FBI's International Corruption Squad in Washington, D.C., investigated the case. The department appreciates the cooperation and
assistance provided by the U.S. Attorneyâs Office of the Eastern District of Kentucky in this matter. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and
Lorinda Laryea of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided
substantial assistance in this matter.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Thursday, June 25, 2020

Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. and Alcon Pte Ltd Agree to Pay over $233 Million Combined to Resolve
Criminal FCPA Cases

Novartis AG, Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I., and Alcon Pte Ltd Agree to Pay over $345 million Combined to Resolve
FCPA Matters with the Government

Novartis Hellas S.A.C.I. (Novartis Greece), a subsidiary of Novartis AG, a Switzerland-based global pharmaceutical company, and Alcon Pte Ltd, a
former subsidiary of Novartis AG and current subsidiary of Alcon Inc., a multinational eye care company, have agreed to pay a combined total of
more than $233 million in criminal monetary penalties to resolve the departmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA).

The resolutions arise out of a Novartis Greece scheme to bribe employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Greece
and to falsely record improper payments relating to the corrupt scheme and similar conduct, and an Alcon Pte Ltd scheme to make and falsely
record improper payments in Vietnam. Novartis AG has also agreed to pay over $112 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) in a related matter.

Novartis Greece entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and the U.S. Attorneyâs Office for the
District of New Jersey in connection with a criminal information filed today in the District of New Jersey charging Novartis Greece with one count
of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to violate the books and records provision of the
FCPA. Pursuant to the deferred prosecution agreement, Novartis Greece has committed to pay a total criminal monetary penalty of $225
million.

Alcon Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Novartis AG at the time of the misconduct, separately entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in
connection with a criminal information filed today in the District of New Jersey charging Alcon Pte Ltd with conspiracy to violate the books and
records provision of the FCPA. Pursuant to the deferred prosecution agreement, Alcon Pte Ltd has committed to pay a total criminal monetary
penalty of approximately $8.9 million.

âNovartis AGâs subsidiaries profited from bribes that induced medical professionals, hospitals, and clinics to prescribe Novartis-branded
pharmaceuticals and use Alcon surgical products, and they falsified their books and records to conceal those bribes,â said Assistant Attorney
General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division. âThe resolutions announced today reflect the paramount
importance of effective compliance programs and the departmentâs commitment to holding companies accountable when they fall short.â

âThe agreement weâre announcing today shows that there will be a heavy price paid by companies that violate our laws, whether at home or
overseas,â said U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito for the District of New Jersey. âJust as importantly, it includes a framework for compliance
reforms that should ensure that these companies conduct their business legally moving forward.â

âThe FBI is committed to fighting any corrupt acts that adversely impact our economy, our citizenry, or our way of life,â said Acting Special
Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski of the FBIâs Newark Field Office. âI say this to every company doing business on the stock exchange - if you
think you can ignore the rules or make up your own, if your business model includes bribery or a quid pro quo, you can count the days until we
show up on your company's doorstep. We will protect our citizens, our economy, our way of life, and bring to justice anyone who breaks the
law.â

According to its admissions, between 2012 and 2015, Novartis Greece conspired with others to violate the FCPA by engaging in a scheme to
bribe employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Greece in order to increase the sale of Novartis-branded
pharmaceutical products. Specifically, Novartis Greece paid for employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics to travel to
international medical congresses, including events held in the United States, as a means to bribe these officials in exchange for increasing the
number of prescriptions they wrote for Lucentis, a prescription drug that Novartis Greece sold. In furtherance of the scheme, Novartis Greece
employees traveled to the United States, and, while located in the United States, facilitated the provision of the improper benefits to publicly-
employed Greek health care providers.

In connection with the resolution, Novartis Greece also admitted that between 2009 and 2010, Novartis Greece made improper payments to
health care providers in connection with an epidemiological study that was intended to increase sales of certain Novartis-branded prescription
drugs. The epidemiological study was used as a vehicle to make improper payments to the health care providers in order to increase sales of
certain Novartis-branded prescription drugs, and Novartis Greece employees recognized that many participating health care providers believed
that they were being paid in exchange for writing prescriptions of Novartis products and not for providing data as part of a clinical study.

In furtherance of both schemes, Novartis Greece, through its employees and agents, knowingly and willfully conspired with others to cause
Novartis AG to mischaracterize and falsely record improper payments related to the international medical congresses and the epidemiological
study in Novartis AGâs books, records, and accounts.

According to its admissions, from 2011 through 2014, Alcon Pte Ltd knowingly and willfully conspired with others to cause Novartis AG to
maintain false books, records and accounts, as a result of a scheme to bribe employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics
in Vietnam. Specifically, the false books and records resulted from a scheme in which Alcon employees in Vietnam made corrupt payments
through a third-party distributor to employees of state-owned and state-controlled hospitals and clinics in Vietnam in order to increase sales of
intraocular lenses. Intraocular lenses are artificial replacement lenses that are implanted in the eye as part of a treatment for a variety of
ailments such as cataracts. Alcon employees in Vietnam, reimbursed the distributor for up to 50 percent of the cost of the corrupt payments,
and these reimbursements were falsely recorded as, among other things, consulting expenses, marketing expenses, and human resource
expenses.

As part of the agreement with Novartis Greece, Novartis Greece agreed to continue to cooperate with the U.S. government in any ongoing or
future criminal investigations concerning Novartis Greece, its executives, employees, or agents. In addition, under the agreement, Novartis
Greece and its parent company, Novartis AG, agreed to enhance their compliance programs and to report to the government on the
implementation of their enhanced compliance programs.

As part of the agreement with Alcon Pte Ltd, Alcon Pte Ltd agreed to continue to cooperate with the government in any ongoing or future
criminal investigations concerning Alcon Pte Ltd, its executives, employees, or agents. In addition, under the agreement, Alcon Pte Ltd and its
parent company, Alcon Inc., agreed to enhance their compliance programs and to report to the government on the implementation of their
enhanced compliance programs.

The government reached these resolutions with Novartis Greece and Alcon Pte Ltd based on a number of factors, including the failure to timely
disclose the conduct that triggered the investigations; the nature and seriousness of the offenses, which spanned multiple years and involved
high level employees; the lack of an effective compliance and ethics program at the time of the misconduct; and credit for each companyâs
respective cooperation. The companies also engaged in remedial measures, including terminating and disciplining individuals who orchestrated
the misconduct, adopting heightened controls and anti-corruption protocols, and significantly increasing the resources devoted to compliance.

The criminal monetary penalty for Novartis Greece reflects a 25 percent reduction off a point near the midpoint of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines range because, although Novartis Greece fully cooperated and remediated, its parent company Novartis AG was involved in similar
conduct for which it previously reached a resolution with the SEC in March 2016.

The criminal monetary penalty for Alcon Pte Ltd reflects a 25 percent reduction off the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range
because of Alcon Pte Ltdâs full cooperation with the government's investigation.

In a related matter with the SEC, Novartis AG agreed to pay the SEC disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling approximately $112
million for the conduct in Greece and Vietnam, as well as additional conduct.

The FBI's Garrett Mountain, New Jersey Field Office is investigating the case. Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud
Section and Senior Trial Counsel Bernard J. Cooney and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua L. Haber of the U.S. Attorneyâs Office Health Care Fraud
Unit are prosecuting the case.

The department appreciates the assistance of the Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs and the significant cooperation provided by
the SEC in this case.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Tuesday, February 18, 2020

Former Alstom Executives and Marubeni Executive Charged with Bribing Indonesian Officials

Two former executives of the Indonesian subsidiary of the French power and transportation company Alstom S.A. and a former executive of the
Japanese trading company Marubeni Corporation have been charged in a superseding indictment unsealed today for their alleged participation
in a scheme to pay bribes to foreign government officials in Indonesia.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney John H. Durham of the District of
Connecticut and Assistant Director in Charge Paul D. Delacout of the FBIâs Los Angeles Office made the announcement.

Reza Moenaf, 63, the former president of Alstomâs subsidiary in Indonesia; Eko Sulianto, 63, the former director of sales of Alstomâs subsidiary
in Indonesia; and Junji Kusunoki, 57, the former deputy general manager of Marubeniâs Overseas Power Project Department, were each charged
with conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Kusunoki was charged with six
counts of violating the FCPA and four counts of money laundering, and Sulianto and Moenaf were each charged with two counts of violating the
FCPA and one count of money laundering.

According to the indictment, the defendants, together with others, paid bribes to officials in Indonesia - including, among others, a high-ranking
member of the Indonesian Parliament and the president of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity
company in Indonesia - in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for Alstomâs subsidiaries
in Connecticut and Indonesia and for Marubeni to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, the
defendants allegedly retained two so-called âconsultantsâ purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of the power company
and its subsidiaries in connection with the Tarahan project. The indictment, however, alleges that the primary purpose for hiring the
consultants was to use the consultants to pay bribes to Indonesian officials.

The first consultant retained by the defendants allegedly received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his Maryland bank account to be used to
bribe the member of Parliament. The consultant then allegedly transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of
the official. According to court documents, emails between the defendants and their co-conspirators discussed in detail the use of the first
consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project.

The superseding indictment alleges that in the fall of 2003, the defendants and their co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was
not effectively bribing key officials at PLN. One email between Moenaf, Sulianto and their co-conspirators described PLN officialsâ âconcern that
if we have won the job, whether their rewards will still be satisfactory or this agent only give them pocket money and disappear.â In another
email, Moenaf asserted that the consultant âhas no grip on the PLN Tender team at allâ and âis more or less similar to [a] cashier which | feel we
pay too much.â As a result, the co-conspirators allegedly retained a second consultant to more effectively bribe PLN officials. The defendants
and their co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the alleged
purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials, the indictment alleges.

An indictment is merely an accusation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of
law.

The charges against Moenaf, Sulianto, and Kusunoki are part of a wide-ranging investigation into alleged corrupt practices by employees of
Alstom and Marubeni. Five other individuals, as well as Alstom and Marubeni, have pleaded guilty in the case so far, and Lawrence Hoskins, a
former senior vice president at Alstom, was found guilty on Nov. 6, 2019, following a jury trial, of 11 counts of conspiracy, violating the FCPA,
and money laundering.

The FBI's Los Angeles Field Office is investigating the case with assistance from the FBIâs Meriden, Connecticut, Resident Agency. The Criminal
Divisionâs Office of International Affairs assisted in the investigation. Senior Deputy Chief Daniel S. Kahn and Assistant Chief Lorinda Laryea of
the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David E. Novick of the District of Connecticut are prosecuting the case.

The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by its law enforcement colleagues in Indonesia, Switzerland's Office of the
Attorney General, as well as authorities in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA

Miami Businessman Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery and Fraud Charges in Connection with
Venezuela Bribery Scheme

The owner of multiple U.S.-based energy companies pleaded guilty yesterday to foreign bribery and fraud charges for his role in a scheme to
corruptly secure energy contracts from Venezuelaâs state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Acting Special Agent in Charge Sean McElroy of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (ICE-HSI) in Houston and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston
Field Office made the announcement.

Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera), 52, of Coral Gables, Florida, pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court before U.S. District Judge Gray H.
Miller of the Southern District of Texas in Houston to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and commit
wire fraud and one count of violating the FCPA. Sentencing is scheduled for July 8, 2016. Four others charged in relation to the case have
pleaded guilty, including three foreign officials.

âThe five convictions announced today hold to account bribe payors as well as the corrupt foreign officials who laundered the bribe money
through the United States,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese individual prosecutions are the result of a tenacious and
coordinated effort by our prosecutors and agents to unravel a complex web of bribes paid to Venezuelan officials. And they demonstrate our
commitment to building cases from the ground up, instead of counting on companies and other wrongdoers to self-disclose their crimes.â

âThe pleas of guilty in this case are the result of the strict enforcement of the FCPA in this district,â said U.S. Attorney Magidson. âBribery under
this law is a serious federal crime that undermines commercial and political relations around the world. This case is an example of our reach to
expose this criminal conduct.â

Shiera was arrested in Miami on Dec. 16, 2015, after a federal grand jury returned an 18-count indictment against him and Roberto Enrique
Rincon Fernandez (Rincon), 55, of The Woodlands, Texas. According to admissions made in connection with Shieraâs plea, Shiera and Rincon
worked together to submit bids to provide equipment and services to PDVSA through their various companies. Shiera admitted that beginning
in 2009, he and Rincon agreed to pay bribes and other things of value to PDVSA purchasing analysts to ensure that his and Rinconâs companies
were placed on PDVSA bidding panels, which enabled the companies to win lucrative energy contracts with PDVSA. Shiera also made bribe
payments to other PDVSA officials in order to ensure that his companies were placed on PDVSA-approved vendor lists and given payment
priority so that they would get paid ahead of other PDVSA vendors with outstanding invoices, he admitted.

âThe corruption of foreign officials through bribery has a damaging impact on the stability of trade, industries and even nations,â said Acting
Special Agent in Charge McElroy. âHSI and our partners will tirelessly investigate anyone who cultivates the corruption of officials abroad and
bribe their way to financial gain.â

âBribery and corruption undermines honest, free enterprise and creates an atmosphere of back room dealing that impairs the ability for honest
businesses to compete,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Cl tirelessly untangles the web of illicit transactions that lead to corrupt
individuals being held accountable.â

Judge Miller also unsealed charges yesterday against four other individuals charged in connection with the investigation. In January 2016,
Moises Abraham Millan Escobar (Millan), 32, of Katy, Texas, pleaded guilty under seal to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA for his role
in the PDVSA bribery scheme. Millan was Shieraâs former employee. In December 2015, three former PDVSA officials, Jose Luis Ramos Castillo
(Ramos), 38; Christian Javier Maldonado Barillas (Maldonado), 39; and Alfonzo Eliezer Gravina Munoz (Gravina), 53, all from Katy, each pleaded
guilty under seal to conspiracy to commit money laundering. As part of their guilty pleas, Ramos, Maldonado and Gravina each admitted that
while employed by PDVSA or its wholly owned subsidiaries or affiliates, they accepted bribes from Shiera and Rincon in exchange for taking
certain actions to assist companies owned by Shiera and Rincon in winning energy contracts with PDVSA. Ramos, Maldonado and Gravina also
admitted that they conspired with Shiera and Rincon to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme. Gravina also pleaded guilty to making
false statements on his 2010 federal income tax return by failing to report the bribe payments he received from Shiera, Rincon and others. As
part of their plea agreements, Shiera, Millan, Ramos, Maldonado and Gravina all agreed to forfeit proceeds of their criminal activity.

The charges against Rincon remain pending. He is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, one count
of conspiracy to commit money laundering, seven counts of money laundering and four counts of violating the FCPA. Rincon was ordered
detained pending trial following a detention hearing held on Dec. 18, 2015, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy K. Johnson of the Southern
District of Texas. The charges contained in the indictment are merely accusations, and Rincon is presumed innocent unless and until proven
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

ICE-HSI and IRS-CI are conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from the FBI. Trial Attorneys Aisling OâShea and Jeremy R. Sanders
of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Deputy Chief John Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert S. Johnson of the Southern District of
Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kristine Rollinson and Vincent Carroll of the Southern District of Texas are handling the
forfeiture aspects of the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided assistance.

Mobile Telesystems Pjsc and Its Uzbek Subsidiary Enter into Resolutions of $850 Million with the
Department of Justice for Paying Bribes in Uzbekistan

Former General Director of MTSâs Uzbek Subsidiary and Former Uzbek Official Charged in Bribery and Money
Laundering Scheme Totaling Almost $1 Billion

Moscow-based Mobile TeleSystems PJSC (MTS), the largest mobile telecommunications company in Russia and an issuer of publicly traded
securities in the United States, and its wholly owned Uzbek subsidiary, KOLORIT DIZAYN INK LLC (KOLORIT), have entered into resolutions with
the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and agreed to pay a combined total penalty of $850 million to resolve
charges arising out of a scheme to pay bribes in Uzbekistan. In addition, charges were unsealed today against a former Uzbek official who is
the daughter of the former president of Uzbekistan and against the former CEO of Uzdunrobita LLC, another MTS subsidiary, for their
participation in a bribery and money laundering scheme involving more than $865 million in bribes from MTS, VimpelCom Limited (now VEON)
and Telia Company AB (Telia) to the former Uzbek official in order to secure her assistance in entering and maintaining their business
operations in Uzbekistanâs telecommunications market.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman of the
Southern District of New York, Special Agent in Charge Raymond Villanueva of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigations (HSI) Washington, D.C. and Chief Don Fort of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) made the announcement.

Gulnara Karimova, 46, a citizen of Uzbekistan, was charged in an indictment filed in the Southern District of New York on March 7 with one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Karimova is a former Uzbek official who allegedly had influence over the Uzbek governmental
body that regulated the telecom industry. Bekhzod Akhmedov, 44, a citizen of Uzbekistan and the former Uzbek executive, was charged in the
same indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), two counts of violating the FCPA, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Karimovaâs and Akhmedovâs case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood of the
Southern District of New York.

âGulnara Karimova stands accused of exploiting her official position to solicit and accept more than $865 million in bribes from three publicly
traded telecom companies, and then laundering those bribes through the U.S. financial system,â said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.
âThe indictment and corporate resolution announced today, together with two prior corporate resolutions involving bribes allegedly paid to
Karimova, demonstrate the Departmentâs comprehensive approach to foreign corruption: we will aggressively pursue both corrupt foreign
officials and the companies and individuals who bribe them in order to gain unfair business advantages, and we will do everything we can to
keep the proceeds of that corruption out of the U.S. financial system.â

âThis is the third installment in a trilogy of cases arising from an almost $1 billion bribery scheme that reached the highest echelons of the
Uzbekistan government and was orchestrated by some of the largest telecommunications companies in the world,â said U.S. Attorney Berman.
âBy funneling multimillion-dollar bribe payments through the U.S. financial system, the companies and individual defendants corruptly tried to
tip the global economy in their favor and line their own pockets. But they are now paying the price. Today, my Office and our law enforcement
partners are sending a bold, unequivocal message that the U.S. financial system is not in business to enable foreign bribery or money
laundering. This Office stands ready to prevent, prosecute, and penalize foreign corrupt practices wherever in the world we find them.â

âCorruption of this level and reach poisons our integrity as a participant in the global marketplace,â said HSI Washington Special Agent in
Charge Villanueva. âThanks to our skillful and collaborative investigators at HSI and the IRS-Cl, Karimova and Ahkmedovâs exploitive crimes will
be presented before the just eye of our courts and no longer will such corruption be permitted to metastasize across our borders.â

âWith the increase in globalization and ease with which funds can be moved, criminals think their financial transactions cannot be trackedâbut
they would be wrong,â said IRS-Cl Chief Fort. âWe will continue to investigate violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to ensure our
countryâs financial institutions are not used for devious purposes. We are committed to aggressively pursuing all who engage in corruption,
money laundering, and bribery for their own personal gain and at the expense of the U.S. government.â

According to the indictment against Karimova and Akhmedov, in or around the early 2000s, they agreed that Akhmedov would solicit and
facilitate corrupt bribe payments from telecommunications companies seeking to enter the Uzbek market. In exchange, Karimova allegedly
used her influence over Uzbek authorities to help the telecommunications companies obtain and retain lucrative business opportunities in the
Uzbek telecommunications market. In total, Akhmedov conspired with the telecom companies and others to pay Karimova more than $865
million in bribes, and Akhmedov and Karimova conspired with others to launder and conceal those funds to, from and through bank accounts in
the United States, in order to promote the ongoing bribery scheme, the indictment alleges.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

MTS entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice in connection with a criminal information filed yesterday in
the Southern District of New York charging the company with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records

provisions of the FCPA and one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA. KOLORIT pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal
information filed in the Southern District of New York, charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery and books and records
provisions of the FCPA. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, MTS agreed to pay a total criminal penalty of $850 million to the United
States, including a $500,000 criminal fine and $40 million in criminal forfeiture that MTS agreed to pay on behalf of KOLORIT. MTS also agreed
to the imposition of an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years and to implement rigorous internal controls and cooperate
fully with the Departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals such as Akhmedov and Karimova. The case against
MTS and KOLORIT is assigned to U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken of the Southern District of New York.

In related proceedings, MTS reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the terms of its agreement with the SEC, MTS agreed to pay a $100
million civil penalty. Consistent with Coordination of Corporate Resolution Penalties in Parallel and/or Joint Investigations and Proceedings
Arising from the Same Misconduct (Justice Manual 1-12.100), the Department of Justice agreed to credit the civil penalty paid to the SEC as part
of its agreement with MTS. Thus, the combined total amount of criminal and regulatory penalties paid by MTS and KOLORIT to U.S. authorities
will be $850 million.

According to the companiesâ admissions, MTS and KOLORIT, through various managers and employees within MTS, MTSâs Uzbek subsidiaries
Uzdunrobita LLC and KOLORIT, and other affiliated entities, paid approximately $420 million in bribes to Karimova, who had influence over the
Uzbek governmental body that regulated the telecom industry. The bribes were paid on multiple occasions between 2004 and 2012 so that
MTS could enter the Uzbek market through the acquisition of Uzdunrobita and so that Uzdunrobita could gain valuable telecom assets and
continue operating in Uzbekistan. The companies admittedly structured and concealed the bribes through payments to shell companies that
members of MTSâs and Uzdunrobitaâs management knew were beneficially owned by Karimova. MTS and Uzdunrobita also acquired KOLORIT,
knowing that the price MTS and Uzdunrobita paid was inflated, in order to bribe Karimova in exchange for Uzdunrobitaâs continuing to operate
in Uzbekistan. Uzdunrobita made payments to purported charities and for sponsorships to entities related to Karimova. The Uzbek government
expropriated Uzdunrobita in 2012 as a result of MTSâs, Uzdunrobitaâs and KOLORITâs failure to meet Karimovaâs demands for additional
payments.

A number of factors contributed to the Departmentâs criminal resolution with the companies, including (1) the companies did not voluntarily
disclose; (2) the companiesâ level of cooperation and remediation was lacking, not proactive; (3) the nature and seriousness of the office,
including $420 million in bribes to a high-level Uzbek official; and (4) the mitigating factors present in this case, including that the Uzbek
government expropriated the companiesâ telecommunications assets in Uzbekistan, resulting in no realized pecuniary gain to the companies as
a result of the misconduct.

The resolution, reached in coordination with the SECâs resolution, marks the third such resolution by a major international telecommunications
provider for bribery in Uzbekistan. On Feb. 18, 2016, Amsterdam-based VimpelCom and its Uzbek subsidiary, Unitel LLC, entered into
resolutions with the Department of Justice and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $114 million in bribery payments to Karimova
between 2006 and 2012. On Sept. 21, 2017, Stockholm-based Telia and its Uzbek subsidiary, Coscom LLC, also entered into resolutions with
the Department and admitted to a conspiracy to make more than $331 million in bribery payments to Karimova. The investigation has thus far
yielded a combined total of over $2.6 billion in global fines and disgorgement, including over $1.3 billion in criminal penalties to the United
States. In related actions, the Department has also filed civil complaints seeking the forfeiture of more than $850 million held in bank accounts
in Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, which constitute bribe payments made by MTS, VimpelCom and Telia, or funds involved in the
laundering of those corrupt payments to Karimova.

 

The IRS-Cl and HSI are investigating the cases as part of the IRS Global Illicit Financial Team in Washington, D.C. Assistant Chief Ephraim
Wernick and Senior Litigation Counsel Nicola J. Mrazek of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Edward Imperatore
and Daniel Noble of the Southern District of New York are prosecuting the case against MTS and KOLORIT. Assistant Chief Wernick and Trial
Attorney Elina Rubin-Smith of the Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Imperatore and Noble are prosecuting the case against Karimova
and Akhmedov. Trial Attorney Michael Khoo of the Criminal Divisionâs Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) is prosecuting
the forfeiture case with substantial assistance from former MLARS Trial Attorney Marie M. Dalton, now an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Western
District of Washington.

Law enforcement authorities in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, France, Ireland, Isle of Man, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands,
Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have provided valuable assistance in this case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International
Affairs provided significant assistance as well. The SEC referred the matter to the Department and also provided extensive cooperation and
assistance.

Russian Nuclear Energy Official Pleads Guilty to Money Laundering Conspiracy Involving
Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

U.S. Conspirators Paid Over $2 Million to Influence Russian Nuclear Energy Official and to Secure Business with State-Owned Russian Nuclear
Energy Company

A Russian official residing in Maryland pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his role in arranging
over $2 million in corrupt payments to influence the awarding of contracts with the Russian state-owned nuclear energy corporation.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein of the District of
Maryland, Deputy Inspector General John R. Hartman of the U.S. Department of Energy-Office of Inspector General (DOE-OIG) and Assistant
Director in Charge Andrew G. McCabe of the FBIâs Washington, D.C., Field Office made the announcement.

Vadim Mikerin, 56, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland.
Sentencing is scheduled before Judge Chuang on Dec. 8, 2015.

According to court documents, Mikerin was the president of TENAM Corporation and a director of the Pan American Department of JSC
Techsnabexport (TENEX). TENAM, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is a wholly-owned subsidiary and the official representative of TENEX in the
United States. TENEX, based in Moscow, acts as the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services
to nuclear power companies worldwide. TENEX is a subsidiary of Russiaâs State Atomic Energy Corporation.

In connection with the scheme, Daren Condrey, 50, of Glenwood, Maryland, pleaded guilty on June 17, 2015, to conspiring to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiring to commit wire fraud, and will be sentenced on Nov. 2, 2015. Boris Rubizhevsky, 64, of Closter,
New Jersey, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2015, to conspiracy to commit money laundering and will be sentenced on Oct. 19, 2015.

According to court documents, between 2004 and October 2014, Mikerin conspired with Condrey, Rubizhevsky and others to transmit funds
from Maryland and elsewhere in the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts located in Cyprus, Latvia and Switzerland. Mikerin
admitted the funds were transmitted with the intent to promote a corrupt payment scheme that violated the FCPA. Specifically, he admitted
that the corrupt payments were made by conspirators to influence Mikerin and to secure improper business advantages for U.S. companies that
did business with TENEX. Mikerin further admitted that he and others used consulting agreements and code words such as âlucky figure,â âLF,â
âcakeâ and âremunerationâ to disguise the corrupt payments.

According to court documents, over the course of the scheme, Mikerin conspired with Condrey, Rubizhevsky and others to transfer
approximately $2,126,622 from the United States to offshore shell company bank accounts. As part of his plea agreement, Mikerin has agreed
to the entry of a forfeiture money judgment in that amount.

The case was investigated by DOE-OIG and the FBI. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro, Ephraim Wernick and
Derek Ettinger of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David |. Salem and Michael T. Packard of the District of
Maryland.

Och-Ziff Capital Management Admits to Role in Africa Bribery Conspiracies and Agrees to Pay
$213 Million Criminal Fine

Och-Ziff Enters into Three-Year Deferred Prosecution Agreement; Subsidiary Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy to Violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act

A New York-based alternative investment and hedge fund manager, Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (Och-Ziff), and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, OZ Africa Management GP LLC (OZ Africa), entered into resolutions to resolve criminal charges and agreed to pay a criminal penalty
of more than $213 million in connection with a widespread scheme involving the bribery of officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
and Libya.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Bitkower of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the
Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office and Chief Richard Weber of
the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-Cl) New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThis case marks the first time a hedge fund has been held to account for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,â said Principal Deputy
Assistant Attorney General Bitkower. âIn its pursuit of profits, Och-Ziff and its agents paid millions in bribes to high-level officials across Africa.
By exposing corruption in this industry, the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section continues to root out wrongdoing of all types in the financial
sector.â

âOch-Ziff, one of the largest hedge funds, positioned itself to profit from the corruption that is sadly endemic in certain parts of Africa, including
in Libya, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chad and Niger,â said U.S. Attorney Capers. âDespite knowing that bribes were being paid to
senior government officials, Och-Ziff repeatedly funded corrupt transactions. One Och-Ziff employee was so bold as to order the removal of
language from their African joint ventureâs internal audit report that called for an investigation of suspected bribery payments by a business
partner. Todayâs corporate resolutions, which include a more than $213 million criminal penalty and an independent compliance monitor, hold
Och-Ziff accountable for placing profits above the law and will help ensure that the conduct brought to light here never happens again at this
company.â

âGaining the upper hand in a business venture by engaging in corrupt practices is bribery in its purest form,â said Assistant Director in Charge
Sweeney. âDoing so with the intention of influencing a foreign official in his or her capacity is nothing short of corruption. In this scheme,
payments of millions of dollars were paid out to senior officials within certain parts of Africa in exchange for access to profitable investment
opportunities. This type of behavior canât and won't be tolerated. | commend the investigators and prosecutors who continue to work together
at home and abroad to vigorously enforce the law within the confines of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.â

âToday's plea and deferred prosecution agreement result from the unraveling of complex financial transactions orchestrated by Och-Ziff Capital
Management Group LLC and its subsidiary to facilitate illegal payments to foreign government officials,â said Chief Weber. âIRS-ClI will continue
to investigate pervasive bribery schemes used by corporations in the pursuit of attractive international investment opportunities.â

Och-Ziff entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in connection with a criminal information charging the company with two counts of
conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), one count of falsifying its books and records and
one count of failing to implement adequate internal controls. Pursuant to its agreement with the department, Och-Ziff agreed to pay a total
criminal penalty of $213,055,689. Och-Ziff also agreed to implement rigorous internal controls, retain a compliance monitor for a term of three
years and cooperate fully with the departmentâs ongoing investigation, including its investigation of individuals.

OZ Africa pleaded guilty to a one-count criminal information filed today and assigned to U.S. District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Eastern
District of New York, charging the company with a conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. Sentencing has been scheduled
for March 29, 2017.

In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against Och-Ziff Capital Management
Group LLC and OZ Management LP, whereby Och-Ziff agreed to pay approximately $199 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including
prejudgment interest. Thus, the combined total amount of U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties paid by Och-Ziff is approximately $412 million.

The DRC Bribery Scheme

According to the companiesâ admissions, in late 2007, Och-Ziff employees began discussions with a businessman operating in the DRC about
entering into a partnership based on special access to lucrative investment opportunities in the DRC involving the countryâs diamond and
mining sectors. Och-Ziff employees learned that the businessman gained access to these attractive investment opportunities by making
corrupt payments to senior government officials in the DRC, the companies admitted. According to the plea agreement, between 2008 and
2012, Och-Ziff entered into several DRC-related transactions in conjunction with the businessman, understanding that Och-Ziffâs funds would be
used, in part, to pay substantial sums of money to high-ranking DRC officials to secure access to, and preference for, the investment
opportunities. In late 2008, after an Och-Ziff employee was alerted that an audit of the businessman's records revealed payments to DRC
officials, that employee instructed that any references to those payments be removed from a final report of the audit, the companies admitted.
According to the plea agreement, the businessman paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes to DRC officials in exchange for investment
opportunities that resulted in more than $90 million in profits for Och-Ziff.
The Libya Bribery Scheme

Och-Ziff also admitted that, beginning in 2007, it engaged a third-party agent to assist the company in securing an investment from the Libyan
Investment Authority (LIA), that countryâs sovereign wealth fund, knowing the agent would need to pay bribes to Libyan officials. The agent was
engaged without formal approval or any due diligence, according to court documents. The company admitted that, beginning in February 2007,
the agent worked on behalf of Och-Ziff to obtain an asset placement from the LIA, including setting up a meeting between a senior Och-Ziff
employee and the Libyan official empowered to make investment decisions for the LIA. According to court documents, in late November 2007,
Och-Ziff received a $300 million investment from the LIA into the companyâs hedge funds. Och-Ziff admitted that it subsequently entered into
an agreement to pay the agent a âfinderâs feeâ of $3.75 million, knowing that all or a portion of the fees would be paid to Libyan officials in
return for their assistance in obtaining the LIAâs investment. In addition, Och-Ziff admitted that it falsified its books and records and attempted
to conceal and disguise the bribes paid through the agent by paying the âfinderâs feeâ through a sham consulting agreement.

Internal Controls Failures and Falsified Books and Records

Och-Ziff also failed to implement and maintain adequate internal accounting controls, which allowed its employees, agents and business
partners to misappropriate assets, the company admitted. As a result of its failure to conduct due diligence on its partners and the lack of
financial controls, Och-Ziff failed to prevent bribe payments from being made in the DRC, Libya, as well as in Chad and Niger, where an Och-Ziff
joint venture made mining-related investments, according to admissions in court documents.

The Corporate Resolutions

The department entered into this resolution in part due to Och-Ziffâs failure to voluntarily self-disclose the companiesâ misconduct to the
department. The resolution also reflects the seriousness of the companiesâ conduct, including the high value of the bribes paid to foreign
officials and the involvement of a high level employee within Och-Ziff. Notwithstanding, the criminal penalty reflects a 20 percent reduction off
the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range because of Och-Ziffâs cooperation with the governmentâs investigation.

* * *

In connection with the governmentâs investigation, Samuel Mebiame, 43, a Gabonese national, was charged on Aug. 16, 2016, with conspiring
to bribe foreign government officials to obtain mining rights in Chad, Niger and Guinea. According to the criminal complaint, Mebiame allegedly
worked as a âfixerâ for a mining company owned by a joint venture between Och-Ziff and an entity incorporated in Turks and Caicos. The
complaint alleges that Mebiame paid bribes to high-ranking government officials in Niger and Chad to obtain mining rights for the joint venture.
The charges against Mebiame are merely allegations, and he is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The FBI's New York Field Office and IRS-Clâs New York office are investigating the case. The department appreciates the significant cooperation
and assistance provided by the SEC in this matter. The Swiss Federal Office of Justice, the British Virgin Islands Central Authority, the Maltese
judicial authorities and authorities in Jersey and Guernsey also provided assistance.

Assistant Deputy Chief Leo Tsao and Trial Attorney James P. McDonald of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys
James P. Loonam, Jonathan P. Lax and David Pitluck of the Eastern District of New Yorkâs Business and Securities Fraud Section are prosecuting
the case. The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Friday, November 22, 2019

Samsung Heavy Industries Company Ltd Agrees to Pay $75 Million in Global Penalties to Resolve
Foreign Bribery Case

Samsung Heavy Industries Company Limited (Samsung Heavy Industries), a South Korea-based engineering company that provides
shipbuilding, offshore platform construction, and other construction and engineering services, has agreed to pay total penalties of more than
$75 million to resolve the government's investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising out of a scheme to pay
millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Brazil.

Samsung Heavy Industries entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department in connection with a criminal information filed
today in the Eastern District of Virginia charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. The case is
assigned to Senior U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis Ill of the Eastern District of Virginia. Pursuant to its agreement with the Department, Samsung
Heavy Industries has committed to pay a total criminal penalty of $75,481,600 - 50 percent ($37,740,800) of which will be paid to the United

to Brazilian authorities pursuant to agreements between Samsung Heavy Industries and the Controladoria-Geral da Uniao (CGU), Advogado-
Geral da Unido (AGU) and MinistÃ©rio Publico Federal (MPF), or will be paid to the United States if at least $37,740,800 in payments are not made
to the Brazilian authorities on or before Nov. 25, 2020. In related proceedings in Brazil, Samsung Heavy Industries entered into a memorandum
of understanding with the CGU and AGU and a complementary agreement for the negotiation of a leniency agreement with the MPF.

âSamsung Heavy Industries paid millions of dollars to a Brazilian intermediary, knowing that some of that money would be used to bribe high-
level executives at Petrobras and obtain a lucrative shipbuilding contract,â said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice
Department's Criminal Division. âTodayâs resolution is yet one more example of the Departmentâs continued commitment to root out bribery
and to work with our foreign counterparts to investigate schemes spanning multiple international jurisdictions.â

âSamsung Heavy Industries caused millions of dollars in corrupt bribe payments to be paid to foreign officials to win business, upsetting what
should have been a level playing field for other companies that followed the rules,â said U.S. Attorney G. Zachary Terwilliger of the Eastern
District of Virginia. âEffective corporate policies and procedures are necessary to ensure that corporations do not engage in foreign bribery. We
will continue to hold corporations accountable.â

âThe FCPA encourages U.S. companies to fairly compete in an open, global marketplace,â said Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the
FBIâs Houston Field Office. âViolations of the FCPA injure the integrity of our free economic system. Our agents work every day to uphold that
economic integrity, and we urge anyone who suspects an FCPA violation to contact their local FBI Field Office.â

According to admissions by Samsung Heavy Industries, beginning in 2007 and continuing until 2013, the company conspired with others to
violate the FCPA by corruptly providing approximately $20 million in commission payments to a Brazilian intermediary, knowing that portions of
the money would be paid as bribes to officials at Petrobras, the Brazilian state-owned oil and state-controlled energy company, in order to
secure improper business advantages and to cause Petrobras to enter into a contract to charter a drill ship that Samsung Heavy Industries was
selling to a Houston-based offshore oil drilling company, which facilitated Samsung Heavy Industries executing the sale of the drill ship.
Samsung Heavy Industries took actions in furtherance of the bribery conspiracy from its branch office located in the United States.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Samsung Heavy Industries has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Department in any
ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals; to enhance its compliance program; and to report to
the Department on the implementation of its enhanced compliance program.

In reaching the resolution with the Department, Samsung Heavy Industries received credit for its cooperation with the Departmentâs
investigation and for taking remedial measures. For example, the company made significant enhancements to its compliance program,
including hiring additional compliance staff, implementing enhanced anti-corruption policies and heightened due diligence controls over third
party vendors, instituting mandatory anti-corruption training and improving whistleblower policies and procedures. The company did not
receive full credit for its cooperation, however, due to its failure to meet reasonable deadlines imposed by the department and delays it caused
in reaching a resolution. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 20 percent reduction off the bottom of the applicable United States
Sentencing Guidelines fine range.

The case is being investigated by the FBI. Trial Attorney Jonathan P. Robell, Acting Assistant Chief Andrew Gentin and Deputy Chief Brian R.
Young of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Uzo Asonye of the Eastern District of Virginia are prosecuting the
case.

The MPF, CGU and AGU in Brazil provided significant assistance in this matter, as did law enforcement authorities in Monaco and Switzerland.
The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance as well.

Four Businessmen and Two Foreign Officials Plead Guilty in Connection with Bribes Paid to
Mexican Aviation Officials

Charges were unsealed against six individuals, all of whom have pleaded guilty for their involvement in schemes to bribe Mexican officials in
order to secure aircraft maintenance and repair contracts with government-owned and controlled entities, and two for conspiring to launder the
proceeds of the schemes.

Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson of the Southern
District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-
HSI) in Houston, Special Agent in Charge Shane Folden of ICE-HSI in San Antonio and Special Agent in Charge Rick Goss of Internal Revenue
Service-Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Houston Field Office made the announcement.

âThe six convictions announced today demonstrate the departmentâs commitment to holding accountable those who further official corruption
through bribery,â said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell. âThese convictions are the result of a coordinated effort by prosecutors and agents
who built the cases brick by brick using traditional law enforcement techniques.â

âHSI special agents and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively investigate financial crimes committed by corrupt foreign
officials,â said Special Agent in Charge Folden. âThis case serves as a reminder that HSI will use all its resources to identify, investigate and
dismantle these criminal networks wherever they operate.â

âThe individuals involved in this scheme paid millions of dollars in bribes to foreign officials in exchange for aviation contracts that placed
legitimate businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage,â said Special Agent in Charge Goss. âIRS-Clâs role in unraveling this scheme
assisted in facilitating the guilty pleas that were announced today.â

Douglas Ray, 55, of Magnolia, Texas, and Victor Hugo Valdez Pinon, 54, a citizen of Mexico, pleaded guilty on Oct. 28 and Oct. 26, 2016,
respectively, before U.S. District Judge Alfred H. Bennett of the Southern District of Texas to conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Kamta Ramnarine, 69, and Daniel Perez, 69, both of Brownsville, Texas, both pleaded guilty on
Nov. 2, 2016, before U.S. District Judge Ricardo H. Hinojosa of the Southern District of Texas to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA.
Ramnarine and Perez are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 30, 2017. Ray and Valdez Pinon are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 23, 2016.

Ernesto Hernandez Montemayor, 55, and Ramiro Ascencio Nevarez, 58, both of whom are citizens of Mexico and were previous officials of
Mexican state government entities, each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Hernandez Montemayor
pleaded guilty before Judge Bennett on Dec. 9, 2015, and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 12, 2017. Nevarez pleaded guilty before Judge
Hinojosa on March 4, 2016, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison on May 27, 2016.

According to the defendantsâ plea agreements, between 2006 and 2016, Ray conspired with Valdez and others to bribe Mexican officials. The
defendants and their co-conspirators, who owned or were associated with companies in the United States that provided aircraft maintenance,
repair, overhaul and related services to customers from the United States and Mexico, paid the bribes in order to secure parts and servicing
contracts with Mexican government-owned customers. Ray agreed to pay bribes to at least seven different foreign officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor, sometimes paying the bribes via wire transfer and checks to accounts in the United States controlled by the officials.
As part of his guilty plea, Hernandez Montemayor admitted that while employed by a Mexican state government, he accepted bribes from Ray,
Ramnarine, Perez and others in exchange for taking certain actions to assist companies they owned in winning business with Hernandez
Montemayorâs state government employer. Hernandez Montemayor also admitted that he conspired with Ray, Ramnarine, Perez and others to
launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

Ramnarine and Perez admitted that, in addition to bribing Hernandez Montemayor, they also conspired to pay bribes to several other foreign
officials between 2007 and 2015 to ensure that their Brownsville-based company won aircraft parts and services contracts with Mexican
government-owned customers. As part of his guilty plea, Nevarez admitted that while employed by a Mexican public university, he accepted
bribes from Ramnarine and Perez in exchange for taking certain actions to assist their company in winning business with the university.
Nevarez also admitted that he conspired with Ramnarine, Perez and others to launder the proceeds of the bribery scheme.

In total, Ray, Valdez Pinon, Ramnarine, Perez and their co-conspirators paid more than $2 million in bribes to Mexican officials, including
Hernandez Montemayor and Nevarez, in order to secure aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul contracts.

ICE-HSI and IRS-CI are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Christopher Cestaro and Kevin R. Gingras of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section
and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jesse Salazar and Arthur Jones of the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division's
Office of International Affairs also provided significant assistance.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the

departmentâs FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

Florida Businessman Pleads Guilty to Foreign Bribery Charges in Connection With Venezuela
Bribery Scheme

A partial owner of several Florida-based energy companies pleaded guilty today to foreign bribery charges for his role in a scheme to corruptly
secure contracts from Venezuela's state-owned and state-controlled energy company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).

Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez of the
Southern District of Texas and Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementâs Homeland Security
Investigationsâ (ICE-HSI) Houston office made the announcement.

Fernando Ardila Rueda (Ardila), 49, of Miami, pleaded guilty in federal court in Houston, to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one count of violating the FCPA. U.S. District Judge Gray H. Miller of the Southern District of Texas accepted
the guilty plea. Sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 8, 2018.

According to admissions made in connection with his plea, Ardila conspired with U.S.-based businessmen Abraham Jose Shiera Bastidas (Shiera)
and Roberto Enrique Rincon Fernandez (Rincon) to pay bribes and other things of value to PDVSA purchasing analysts. The bribes were paid to
ensure that Shieraâs and Rinconâs companies were placed on PDVSA bidding panels and in order to obtain or retain business with PDVSA. From
2008 through 2014, while he was sales director, manager and partial owner of several of Shieraâs companies, Ardila provided entertainment and
offered bribes to PDVSA officials based on a percentage of the value of contracts the officials helped to award to Shieraâs companies.

Rincon, Shiera and two other former employees of Shieraâs companies have also pleaded guilty in the case. Including Ardila, the Justice
Department has announced a total of 10 individuals have pleaded guilty and are pending sentencing as part of a larger, ongoing investigation
by the U.S. government into bribery at PDVSA.

ICE-HSI is conducting the ongoing investigation with assistance from IRS-Criminal Investigation. Trial Attorneys Aisling O'Shea and Jeremy R.
Sanders of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys (AUSA) John Pearson and Robert S. Johnson of the Southern
District of Texas are prosecuting the case. AUSA Kristine Rollinson of the Southern District of Texas is handling the forfeiture aspects of the
case,

Goldman Sachs Charged in Foreign Bribery Case and Agrees to Pay Over $2.9 Billion

The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (Goldman Sachs or the Company), a global financial institution headquartered in New York, New York, and
Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. (GS Malaysia), its Malaysian subsidiary, have admitted to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with a scheme to pay over $1 billion in bribes to Malaysian and Abu Dhabi officials to obtain lucrative
business for Goldman Sachs, including its role in underwriting approximately $6.5 billion in three bond deals for 1Malaysia Development Bhd.
(1MDB), for which the bank earned hundreds of millions in fees. Goldman Sachs will pay more than $2.9 billion as part of a coordinated
resolution with criminal and civil authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore, and elsewhere.

Goldman Sachs entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed today in the
Eastern District of New York charging the Company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. GS Malaysia pleaded
guilty in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York to a one-count criminal information charging it with conspiracy to violate the
anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA.

Previously, Tim Leissner, the former Southeast Asia Chairman and participating managing director of Goldman Sachs, pleaded guilty to
conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng Chong Hwa, also known as âRoger Ng,â former managing director of Goldman and
head of investment banking for GS Malaysia, has been charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA. Ng was extradited
from Malaysia to face these charges and is scheduled to stand trial in March 2021. The cases are assigned to U.S. District Judge Margo K.
Brodie of the Eastern District of New York.

In addition to these criminal charges, the department has recovered, or assisted in the recovery of, in excess of $1 billion in assets for Malaysia
associated with and traceable to the 1MDB money laundering and bribery scheme.

âGoldman Sachs today accepted responsibility for its role in a conspiracy to bribe high-ranking foreign officials to obtain lucrative

underwriting and other business relating to 1MDB,â said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal
Division. âTodayâs resolution, which requires Goldman Sachs to admit wrongdoing and pay nearly three billion dollars in penalties, fines, and
disgorgement, holds the bank accountable for this criminal scheme and demonstrates the departmentâs continuing commitment

to combatting corruption and protecting the U.S. financial system.â

âOver a period of five years, Goldman Sachs participated in a sweeping international corruption scheme, conspiring to avail itself of more than
$1.6 billion in bribes to multiple high-level government officials across several countries so that the company could reap hundreds of millions of
dollars in fees, all to the detriment of the people of Malaysia and the reputation of American financial institutions operating abroad,â said Acting
U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York. âTodayâs resolution, which includes a criminal guilty plea by Goldman
Sachsâ subsidiary in Malaysia, demonstrates that the department will hold accountable any institution that violates U.S. law anywhere in the
world by unfairly tilting the scales through corrupt practices.â

âWhen government officials and business executives secretly work together behind the scenes for their own illegal benefit, and not that of their
citizens and shareholders, their behavior lends credibility to the narrative that businesses donât succeed based on the quality of their products,
but rather their willingness to play dirty,â said Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office. âGreed
eventually exacts an immense cost on society, and unchecked corrupt behavior erodes trust in public institutions and government entities alike.
This case represents the largest ever penalty paid to U.S. authorities in an FCPA case. Our investigation into the looting of funds from 1MDB
remains ongoing. If anyone has information that could assist the case, call us at 1-800-CALLFBI.â

âIMDB was established to drive strategic initiatives for the long-term economic development of Malaysia. Goldman Sachs admitted today that
one billion dollars of the money earmarked to help the people of Malaysia was actually diverted and used to pay bribes to Malaysian and Abu
Dhabi officials to obtain their business,â said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner of IRS Criminal Investigationâs (IRS-Cl) Los Angeles Field
Office. âTodayâs guilty pleas demonstrate that the law applies to everyone, including large investment banks like Goldman Sachs. IRS Criminal
Investigation will work tirelessly alongside our law enforcement partners to identify and bring to justice those who engage in fraud and deceit
around the globe. When the American financial system is misused for corruption, the IRS will take notice and we will take action.â

According to Goldmanâs admissions and court documents, between approximately 2009 and 2014, Goldman conspired with others to violate the
FCPA by engaging in a scheme to pay more than $1.6 billion in bribes, directly and indirectly, to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi in
order to obtain and retain business for Goldman from 1MDB, a Malaysian state-owned and state-controlled fund created to pursue investment
and development projects for the economic benefit of Malaysia and its people. Specifically, the Company admitted to engaging in the bribery
scheme through certain of its employees and agents, including Leissner, Ng, and a former executive who was a participating managing director
and held leadership positions in Asia (Employee 1), in exchange for lucrative business and other advantages and opportunities. These included,
among other things, securing Goldmanâs role as an advisor on energy acquisitions, as underwriter on three lucrative bond deals with a total
value of $6.5 billion, and a potential role in a highly anticipated and even more lucrative initial public offering for 1MDBâs energy assets. As
Goldman admitted â and as alleged in the indictment pending in the Eastern District of New York against Ng and Low â in furtherance of the
scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired to pay bribes to numerous foreign officials, including high-ranking officials in the
Malaysian government, 1MDB, Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment
Company (IPIC), and Abu Dhabiâs state-owned and state-controlled joint stock company, Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar).

Goldman admitted today that, in order to effectuate the scheme, Leissner, Ng, Employee 1, and others conspired with Low Taek |ho, aka Jho
Low, to promise and pay over $1.6 billion in bribes to Malaysian, 1MDB, IPIC, and Aabar officials. The co-conspirators allegedly paid these
bribes using more than $2.7 billion in funds that Low, Leissner, and other members of the conspiracy diverted and misappropriated from the
bond offerings underwritten by Goldman. Leissner, Ng and Low also retained a portion of the misappropriated funds for themselves and other
co-conspirators. Goldman admitted that, through Leissner, Ng, Employee 1 and others, the bank used Lowâs connections to advance and
further the bribery scheme, ultimately ensuring that IMDB awarded Goldman a role on three bond transactions between 2012 and 2013, known
internally at Goldman as âProject Magnolia,â âProject Maximus,â and âProject Catalyze.â

Goldman also admitted that, although employees serving as part of Goldmanâs control functions knew that any transaction involving Low posed
a significant risk, and although they were on notice that Low was involved in the transactions, they did not take reasonable steps to ensure that
Low was not involved. Goldman further admitted that there were significant red flags raised during the due diligence process and afterward â
including but not limited to Lowâs involvement â that either were ignored or only nominally addressed so that the transactions would be
approved and Goldman could continue to do business with 1MDB. As a result of the scheme, Goldman received approximately $606 million in
fees and revenue, and increased its stature and presence in Southeast Asia.

Under the terms of the agreements, Goldman will pay a criminal penalty and disgorgement of over $2.9 billion. Goldman also has reached
separate parallel resolutions with foreign authorities in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, and elsewhere, along with domestic
authorities in the United States. The department will credit over $1.6 billion in payments with respect to those resolutions.

The department reached this resolution with Goldman based on a number of factors, including the Companyâs failure to voluntarily disclose the
conduct to the department; the nature and seriousness of the offense, which included the involvement of high-level employees within the
Companyâs investment bank and others who ignored significant red flags; the involvement of various Goldman subsidiaries across the world;
the amount of the bribes, which totaled over $1.6 billion; the number and high-level nature of the bribe recipients, which included at least 11
foreign officials, including high-ranking officials of the Malaysian government; and the significant amount of actual loss incurred by IMDB as a
result of the co-conspiratorsâ conduct. Goldman received partial credit for its cooperation with the departmentâs investigation, but did not
receive full credit for cooperation because it significantly delayed producing relevant evidence, including recorded phone calls in which the
Companyâs bankers, executives, and control function personnel discussed allegations of bribery and misconduct relating to the conduct in the
statement of facts. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 10 percent reduction off the bottom of the applicable U.S. sentencing
guidelines fine range.

Low has also been indicted for conspiracy to commit money laundering and violate the FCPA, along with Ng, E.D.N.Y. Docket No. 18-CR-538
(MKB). Low remains a fugitive. The charges in the indictment as to Low and Ng are merely allegations, and those defendants are presumed
innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The investigation was conducted by the FBIâs International Corruption Unit and IRS-Cl. The prosecution is being handled by the Criminal
Divisionâs Fraud Section and the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. Trial Attorneys Katherine Nielsen, Nikhila Raj, Jennifer E. Ambuehl, Woo S. Lee, Mary
Ann McCarthy, Leo Tsao, and David Last of the Criminal Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Alixandra Smith and Drew
Rolle of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case. Additional Criminal Division Trial Attorneys and Assistant U.S. Attorneys
within U.S. Attorneyâs Offices for the Eastern District of New York and Central District of California have provided valuable assistance with
various aspects of this investigation, including with civil and criminal forfeitures. The Justice Departmentâs Office of International Affairs of the
Criminal Division provided critical assistance in this case.

The department also appreciates the significant assistance provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; the New York State Department of Financial Services, the
United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority; the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority; the Attorney Generalâs Chambers of
Singapore; the Singapore Police Force-Commercial Affairs Division; the Monetary Authority of Singapore; the Office of the Attorney General and
the Federal Office of Justice of Switzerland; the judicial investigating authority of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and the Criminal Investigation
Department of the Grand-Ducal Police of Luxembourg; the Attorney Generalâs Chambers of Malaysia; the Royal Malaysian Police; and the
Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission. The department also expresses its appreciation for the assistance provided by the Ministry of Justice of
France; the Attorney General's Office of the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Guernsey Economic Crime Division.

The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Departmentâs FCPA
enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/foreign-corrupt-practices-act.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.

MLARSâs Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, in partnership with federal law enforcement agencies, and often with U.S. Attorney's Offices,
seeks to forfeit the proceeds of foreign official corruption and, where appropriate, to use those recovered assets to benefit the people harmed
by these acts of corruption and abuse of office.

Legg Mason Inc. Agrees to Pay $64 Million in Criminal Penalties and Disgorgement to Resolve
FCPA Charges Related to Bribery of Gaddafi-Era Libyan Officials

Legg Mason Inc. (Legg Mason), a Maryland-based investment management firm, has entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the
Department of Justice and agreed to pay $64.2 million to resolve the Departmentâs investigation into violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA) in connection with Legg Masonâs participation, through a subsidiary, in a Libyan bribery scheme.

Acting Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the
Eastern District of New York, Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI New York Field Office and Deputy Chief Eric Hylton of
IRS Criminal Investigation made the announcement.

According to Legg Mason's admissions, between 2004 and 2010, a Legg Mason subsidiary, Permal Group Ltd. (Permal), partnered with SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale S.A. (SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale), a multinational bank headquartered in Paris, France, to solicit business from state-owned financial institutions
in Libya. During this time, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale paid bribes through a Libyan âbrokerâ in connection with 14 investments made by Libyan state-
owned financial institutions. For each transaction, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale paid the Libyan broker a commission of between one and a half and three
percent of the nominal amount of the investments made by the Libyan state institutions. In connection with seven of the transactions, SociÃ©tÃ©
GÃ©nÃ©rale paid commissions to the Libyan broker to benefit Legg Mason, through its subsidiary Permal, which managed funds invested by the
Libyan state institutions. In total, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale paid the Libyan Intermediary over $90 million, portions of which the Libyan broker paid to
high-level Libyan officials in order to secure the investments from various Libyan state institutions for SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. As a result of the
corrupt scheme, SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale obtained 13 investments and one restructuring from the Libyan state institutions worth a total of
approximately $3.66 billion, and earned profits of approximately $523 million. Legg Mason, through Permal, managed seven of these
investments and earned profits of approximately $31.6 million.

Legg Mason entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay $64.2 million to resolve the matter. This payment includes a penalty
of $32.625 million to be paid to the U.S. Treasury within five days of the agreement, and disgorgement of $31.617 million, which will be credited
against disgorgement paid to other law enforcement authorities within the first year of the agreement. As part of the non-prosecution
agreement, Legg Mason has agreed to continue to cooperate with the Department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to
the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program and to report to the Department on the implementation of its
enhanced compliance program.

The Department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that Legg Mason did not voluntarily and timely disclose the
conduct at issue, but fully cooperated in the investigation and fully remediated. Moreover, Legg Masonâs misconduct involved only mid-to-lower
level employees of Permal, a subsidiary company, and was not pervasive throughout Legg Mason or Permal; SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale - and not Legg
Mason or Permal - maintained the relationship with the Libyan broker and was responsible for originating and leading the scheme; the profits
earned by Legg Mason and Permal were less than one-tenth of the profits earned by SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale; and neither Legg Mason nor Permal has
a history of similar misconduct.

The FBI's New York Field Office and IRS-Clâs New York office are investigating the case. Trial Attorneys Dennis R. Kihm and Gerald M. Moody Jr.
of the Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys David C. Pitluck and James P. McDonald of the Eastern District of New York
are prosecuting this matter. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this investigation.

The Department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in this
matter. Franceâs Parquet National Financier, the United Kingdomâs Serious Fraud Office, Switzerlandâs Office of the Attorney General and
Federal Office of Justice also provided significant cooperation.

The Criminal Divisionâs Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice
Department's Fraud Section FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www. justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.

A four-count indictment was returned on Dec. 19, 2018, by a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York, charging two executives of a
shipbuilding company, three former senior Mozambican government officials, and three former London-based investment bankers for their roles
in a $2 billion fraud and money laundering scheme that victimized investors from the United States and elsewhere.

Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Departmentâs Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern
District of New York, and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBIâs New York Field Office made the announcement.

âThe indictment unsealed today alleges a brazen international criminal scheme in which corrupt Mozambique government officials, corporate
executives, and investment bankers stole approximately $200 million in loan proceeds that were meant to benefit the people of Mozambique,â
said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski. âThe Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners are dedicated to using all tools at
our disposal to prosecute those who engage in money laundering, financial fraud and corruption at the expense of U.S. investors, wherever
those individuals may be located.â

âAs charged in the indictment, the defendants orchestrated an immense fraud and bribery scheme that took advantage of the U.S. financial
system, defrauded its investors and adversely impacted the economy of Mozambique, in order to line their own pockets with hundreds of
millions of dollars,â said U.S. Attorney Donoghue. âThis indictment underscores the Department of Justiceâs continuing efforts to end such
fraudulent and corrupt practices and to hold those responsible to account for their crimes.â

âToday's indictment proves that no matter who you are, or what position of power you're in, you're not immune from prosecution,â said FBI
Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney. âThe FBI will continue to use all resources at our disposal to uncover crimes of this nature and expose
them for what they really are.â

Jean Boustani, 40, a citizen of Lebanon who worked for the Privinvest Group, a United Arab Emirates-based shipbuilding company, was arrested
at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Jan. 2, 2019 and arraigned later that day in the Eastern District of New York on charges that he
conspired with others to commit one count of wire fraud, one count of securities fraud, and one count of money laundering in connection with
$200 million in bribe and kickback payments he helped organize relating to three loans totaling more than $2 billion that were marketed and
sold to U.S. victim investors. Boustani has pleaded not guilty to the charges; a trial date has not yet been set. Alongside Boustani, Privinvestâs
chief financial officer Najib Allam, 58, a citizen of Lebanon, was charged with the same counts. Allam is alleged to have worked with Boustani to
make the bribe and kickback payments. Allam is not currently in U.S. custody.

Manuel Chang, 63, the former Mozambican minister of finance who is a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was charged with the same counts
as Boustani, namely one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of
conspiracy to commit money laundering. Chang was arrested at the request of the United States by South African authorities on Dec. 29,
2018. The United States is seeking Changâs extradition.

Antonio do Rosario, 44, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, was an official with Mozambiqueâs State Information and Security Service and a
director and officer of each of the three Mozambican entities that obtained the maritime loans. Do Rosario was charged with one count of
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering
in connection with his receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Do Rosario is not currently in U.S. custody.

Teofilo Nhangumele, 50, a citizen and resident of Mozambique, acted on behalf of the Office of the President of Mozambique. Nhangumele was
charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with his
negotiation and receipt of bribe payments relating to the loans. Nhangumele is not currently in U.S. custody.

The three investment bankers, Andrew Pearse, 49; Surjan Singh, 44; and Detelina Subeva, 37, each of whom is a resident of the United
Kingdom, were also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and one
count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In addition, each banker was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery
and internal controls provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in connection with their roles in facilitating bribe payments to
government officials in Mozambique and for circumventing the internal accounting controls of a foreign investment bank that arranged two of
the loans. At the time, Pearse and Singh were managing directors of the investment bank, and Subeva was a vice president.

Pearse, Singh and Subeva were arrested on Jan. 3, in the United Kingdom, all pursuant to provisional arrest warrants issued at the request of
the United States. The United States is seeking their extradition.

The indictment alleges that between approximately 2013 and 2016, the co-conspirators organized for more than $2 billion in three loans to be
arranged by Investment Bank and another foreign bank. The loans were made to companies owned and controlled by the Mozambican
government: Proindicus S.A., Empresa Mocambicana de Atum, S.A. (EMATUM) and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM). The money was
purportedly to be used to fund three maritime projects for which the shipbuilder, Privinvest, would provide the equipment and services.
Proindicus was to perform coastal surveillance, EMATUM was to engage in tuna fishing, and MAM was to build and maintain shipyards. Chang,
in his capacity as minister of finance, signed guarantees on behalf of Mozambique for all three fraudulent loans. Singh signed the agreements
on behalf of the investment bank for the two loans on which the bank acted as primary arranger. The investment bank subsequently paid the
loans directly to Privinvest.

As further alleged in the indictment, the co-conspirators facilitated Privinvestâs criminal diversion of more than $200 million in loan proceeds,
including more than $150 million in bribe payments to Chang and other Mozambican government officials that Privinvest paid to ensure that
Mozambique would enter into the loan arrangements. In addition to the bribe payments, the alleged fraud also included approximately $50
million in kickback payments to Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, who assisted the conspirators to obtain financing for the loans through their
investment bank and a second foreign investment bank. Pearse, Singh, and Subeva, along with the other members of the conspiracy, allegedly
subsequently sold the loans to investors worldwide, including in the United States. Moreover, the participants in the scheme allegedly
conspired to defraud these investors by misrepresenting how the loan proceeds would be used, the amount and maturity dates of other loans
and debt Mozambique was obligated to pay, and the ability of Mozambique or its state-owned entities to repay the loans.

Mozambique and its state-owned entities have thus far allegedly failed to make more than $700 million of repayments that have become due
on the loans.

The charges in the indictment are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law.

The investigation is being conducted by the FBIâs New York Field Office. The governmentâs case is being prosecuted by the Criminal Divisionâs
Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Fraud Section, and the Business and Securities Fraud Section of the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York. MLARS Trial Attorneys Sean W. O'Donnell and Margaret A. Moeser, Fraud Section Trial Attorney
David M. Fuhr, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew S. Amatruda and Mark E. Bini of the Eastern District of New York are prosecuting the case.

The Criminal Divisionâs Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case. The Department appreciates the significant
cooperation and assistance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Department also appreciates the assistance provided by
law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.

MLARS'âs Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and
employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.
